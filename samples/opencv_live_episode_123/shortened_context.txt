I mean that makes sense um that makes sense hadn't thought
of that yeah yeah I had not thought about that but that now makes sense shout out to Gabriel and YouTube for
that one all right okay so in apple Vision Pro where are these things located I actually uh
started when I got this the very first one of the very first things I did was I started counting the cameras there are
12 cameras of which I could find only eight because these u a cameras are
located inside I I've you know I've tried to shine light into it and try to figure out but they are not visible at
least not to me uh through uh through these but I got this uh from the URL
that I am showing and I think Apple may have released this thing at some point uh last year so you can see that there
are two IR cameras not just one but uh per eye and so there are four IR cameras
so out of the 12 cameras four cameras are dedicated for just uh ey tracking uh
that's how important the problem is right and you can see that there are these uh LED lights all over um you know
surrounding that and so you'll see several LED lights not just uh one that illuminates the and that is why you know
all these things extra cameras extra lights they all uh make sure that the quality is really good
