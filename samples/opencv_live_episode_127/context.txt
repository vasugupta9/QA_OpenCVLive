joining us so quick um as you join us wherever you're joining us from please
let us know in the chat system wherever you're watching where you're joining from I am coming to you from beautiful
downtown San Francisco California and our stalwart host Dr SAA Malik is coming
to us from from San Diego California and our illustrious guest
mortaza Hassan where are you coming to us from coming from laor Pakistan right
on I see uh Steve from Toronto how you doing Steve another San Franciscan night
here good hello Maine hello
India hello Pakistan hello Ukraine hello
Mexico the people who are uh writing on the uh on the chat please uh move please
uh you know respond to everybody so that uh everybody here gets to know where you're joining from yeah there's a if
you're watching in Zoom there's a little checkbox or a drop down to everyone or Two Hosts and panelists make sure that's
set to everyone that'll make sure everybody sees where you coming from we got uh Romania Texas
Colorado yes yes yes love to see it folks
good morning to the 10 of you watching on YouTube the three of you watching on Twitter and the 50 of you watching on
LinkedIn so far and the the 42 of you here in
Zoom got a little bit of stuff to talk about at the top of the show here just a few minutes but this is going to be
really exciting one we're going to talk about the future of drones and AI with um you know one of the one of the the
experts in the field definitely a YouTube channel that I subscribe to so it's always good when we have people on
the show that I actually follow you know before they're on the show I always enjoy
that hello Los Angeles Yokohama Arizona Nigeria the moon I don't believe
you um Colorado again more San Francisco
the United Kingdom yes indeed
all right boss I think it's about time to get started you ready yeah let's get started hello everyone welcome to opencv
live I'm Dr Sacha Malik and I'm the CEO of open cv. org Our Guest this week is
moraza Hassan an educator and YouTube entrepreneur in the field of computer vision and Robotics you may best know
him from his YouTube channel M's Workshop that has over over 390,000
subscribers M has deep experience in computer vision Robotics and Ai and we
are so excited to hear what he has to say on the future of drones and AI but
before we start the presentation with me always is opencv's director of content
and creative Phil Nelson he organizes this show and if anything goes wrong it's his fault that's right it's all
about the boom I am your Co co-host with the coost the second banana who is second to none I'm also your plus one and only it's Mr Nelson if you're nasty
but you my dear friends can call me Phil and I'm here to remind you of a few things we do on every single episode of
this show the first of which is a giveaway to you in the audience later on in the episode Our Guest has generously
uh decided to give us three of their drone courses to give away so stay tuned later in the episode you will have three
chances to win today thanks to our generous guest we're also taking
questions from you in the audience and we will do our best to answer them directly use the zoom Q&A button at the
bottom of the screen to ask your question at any time if you're watching on Zoom or use the chat system wherever
you're watching I'm monitoring those and I'll try to get to your question during the show back to you
SAA well so um I mean welcome mza and uh I'm pretty certain that a lot of people
in the audience already follow your uh YouTube channel and they would be very excited to hear uh from you so uh let's
let's get started I mean uh we have had people talk about drones uh you know we
have had people from the Drone foundation and uh it's it's it's great
that way but uh this is where you know uh the rubber meets the road right you
are going to show us about how to get started with drone programming Etc and we are going to be you know that that's
a very exciting field for some somebody who's not uh who doesn't know where to start right so welcome uh to the show uh
you can start by a little introduction if we missed out uh something and then we'll uh we'll go with the slides
welcome thank you very much thank you very much uh it's an honor to be here thank you very much Dr Satya and
Phil I'm having a little bit of a sore throat so you please bear with me uh
hopefully it will get better as we go along so today we are going to speak
about the the future of drones and how Ai and drone will be getting together
and it will lead us into the future but before we do that uh is it possible to do a poll um can we yeah we can do a
poll well we've never actually done you want to pull okay so I have a I have a simple
question uh there's a concept that if you have two eyes then you can easily do
depth perception which means that you can tell how far an object is now the question comes that if
I close my one eye or let's say if if a person is blind from one eye should they
be able to drive or not should should it should they get a driver's license or not that's the
question all right I'm posting it now so a simple yes and no would do I
guess yeah so so the question I will repeat again
will a person who does not see from one eye has only one eye to see from should
they be allowed a driver's license given that depth perception is
perceived using two eyes so I know our our hosts they are
they know the answer they don't want to say it right or they do want to say it well we will after after the poll is
over right most of the people appear to be saying yes uh because um I I see
almost two to one uh yeses more yeses one okay 11 12 13 it's more than that
actually it's like three quarters yeses like three quter yeses I see some people
mentioning time of flight already so right pretty good time of flight yeah
not sure where that's coming from but we'll find out we'll find out it seems like everyone's saying yes everyone is
saying yes so that is actually right because you don't sorry you don't
actually need two eyes to do depth perception you can do it from one eye as well so this means that uh I can tell
how far an object is even when my eyes are clo uh one of my eyes are closed so
um the the question really is especially when it comes to computer vision the
question is the software because we don't need eight cameras or we don't
need 10 cameras on our car sorry we just need one camera to
actually do all the processing the main thing is the software behind it so if we
have a good enough software in theory we should be able to have our self-driving
car right U just to add does that sense yeah so just to add to it first of all
uh depth perception is obviously better with two eyes but you don't need two eyes for depth perception because depth
is there are many cues first of all uh people who have one eye they estimate
depth using depth from Focus right uh and it is not just one uh Q right you
don't need two eyes the the amount of focus the amount of effort it it takes to focus on something gives you an
estimate of the depth um but it's also through experience right all the AI models they don't have this uh focusing
mechanism right because they are looking at a picture only they don't have a mechanism to change the focal length
right like we do with our eyes when we change the Focus right but they learn from experience right that this uh this
cup that is in front of me it is at such and such distance and therefore you can
actually uh estimate the depth if it is not being fooled you can easily fool
with a single image you can feel an fool an AI model you know everything can be scaled you can have a tiny house a tiny
car and everything and then you don't know uh what is the uh Act height it would think that Force
perspective is yeah that's definitely a fun trick also their other senses as well will
will you know sound and and even smell right you can tell if something's close to you if you can smell it or not right
like it's it's just kind of that sort of thing yeah but the same thing goes for humans as well like we could be fooled
as well with image right if the house is big or small yeah it's easy to that's a
fundamental ambigu that's FAL amby uh there is no way to tell scale from a
single image but if you're in a traffic environment obviously and you're not trying to fool the system actively then
that's a different thing right then you can estimate exactly yeah okay great so
let's begin with our presentation um can everyone see the
presentation yeah looks good shout out to the 140 viewers on LinkedIn right now
and the 80 of them here in zoom we're we're crossing we're getting close to the 300 barrier here hooray oh great so
can we welcome everyone welcome can we pin the presentation so uh moraza is I
mean definitely you got it there you
go well so it doesn't show up on mine um but people who are watching if you could
go and pin the uh Mora's uh window uh I I think for uh each one of you you'll
have to do it individually you will be able to see a big screen oh okay so I guess when I speak
they will be able to see no no it's it's fine I think uh right now uh if how
about that I hit I hit Spotlight there's two ways to do it there's pin and Spotlight Spotlight might have done it
okay okay I hope everyone can see now now it's good now I don't need to okay
good all right so don't look at the do uh I guess everybody is too late too
late I failed already too late okay so today we will be talking about the future of AI and
drones so uh let's start with a video of Mark Rober now you will not be able to
hear this but let me actually remove the
audio because I can hear it too loud so you won't be able to hear it but
I will explain what exactly is happening and what they are saying so I hope
everyone knows Mark Rober he's one of the biggest YouTubers out there and he does a lot with science and technology
so he's basically demonstrating that there is a company that actually delivers these packages directly to your
home with a dart Precision so the similar way you throw a DOT and there's
accuracy that accuracy is replicated here with these drones so surely if Mark
Rober is saying that this is the future of drones then definitely it should be
right and if we see that there's a lot of companies that are putting a lot of
money and effort in developing these drones so we have DHL we have UPS FedEx
Amazon so a lot of big num uh names are actually putting their efforts to
Walmart well has like some inhouse tech they're working on the the world's largest retailer Walmart yes exactly
they do have it as well so one might think that okay uh Mark Rober is saying
a lot of companies are saying then definitely this is the future of drones and this is where we are head it
right actually that's not true uh at least in my opinion you see uh DHL and
Amazon are one of the biggest players in this game and recently DHL completely
shut down their drone facility after eight years of research and Amazon is
basically in a decline and a lot of rumors are there that their staff
actually doesn't work on the drones they just sit and enjoy time I'm not sure if
that is correct or wrong so but but there are reports of that so now the
question comes allegedly allegedly we don't want to get Su over here yes allegedly so so the question comes that
in in in the beginning I'm saying the future of AI drones and uh we are
talking about the future of drones and then on the first slide I'm showing you something that it is a decline and
people are actually shutting down one of the biggest players are shutting down so what exactly is happening here right so
it's it's um contradicting so I will give you the answer by the end of the slide so what
we will do is we will go step by step and try to understand along the way what actually is happening throughout uh
right now so uh I don't want to just give raw information of this is what this is doing this is this company doing
this I mean that's okay but that's only news so what we'll do is we'll start with a brief story and then I will share
a road map to learning AI because nowadays A lot of people they talk about
AI but when you ask them they don't know where to begin so I'm I'm going to give you a a small road map which you can
start right away and it will be completely free then uh we will discuss
about what are the basics of drones and then we will look at how exactly can you
program a small drone then we will look into the Futures uh future of drone and
the last thing is a secret video that I will unveil at the end of this
webinar love it we love we love sec secret
okay so far so good right okay so we will begin with the story so the story
is actually of myself uh I would like to share this story because it is very crucial to my journey in computer vision
see what happened was that I was back uh this was back in 2012 uh I was in my University studying
my bachelor's degree in mechatronics a lot of people ask where did I study it was in university of Norland
uh their Malaysia campus so I was studying back then and somebody told me or I came across this
information that images are made up of boxes and these boxes they contain some
numbers inside them now this was the first that I was hearing this and when I
heard this I I was surprised I was shocked and I was intrigued as well that
I want to see this in action so what I did was I went on uh to my my computer I
zoomed in in a picture and while I could see some boxes there I didn't see any
numbers so I went online I researched how how can I do that and there was a
software uh you probably know Matlab which had a graphical interface which allowed you to zoom in until you saw the
numbers and that's what I did so I went to mat lab I went to the university lab
and I zoomed in and there I saw the numbers and that was the first time I
understood images right so that was really fascinating for me because I
could really understand the concept behind 30p 40p or 720 because back then
it wasn't I think HD so we had uh these um resolutions on YouTube I understood
how these images work what are the colors of these what is grayscale and all of that just because of that uh
viewing of this pixel with numbers so then what I did I got really
fascinated with this and I said I'm going to do a computer vision project my final year project has to be related to
computer vision so I started working on it uh I created a robot arm uh this is
the complete video back then I used to make videos as well but I never posted them uh so this was the graphical
interface of Matlab and uh this was the uh what do you call the the open CV uh
no back then I didn't use open CV this was the color classification basically red blue and
green uh in mat lab yeah they had this uh library that helped you and all of
that and here you can see the result now the reason I'm sharing the
story is because I myself got inspired from another content creator uh his name
is sendex well his channel is sendex his name is uh I believe uh Harrison
Kenley right so uh it's a difficult name that's why and his YouTube channel is
actually synex so it's difficult to remember his name a little bit so
anyways so I got inspired from his story and that's why I'm sharing my story as well that in hopes that anyone could
maybe start their computer vision Journey after this so that was the basic idea start finish how much how much uh
time did you spend to get this thing working uh six months or uh this took me
around three months uh I actually did it before the semester started and I
pitched it as a final year project I had already done it because I was so uh you
know intrigued I wanted to create it and I had half of it was already done you
know the hardware part and the software part and then I had to do just the written part so most of the time the
last year I spent my uh helping my friends do their financial projects instead of when I was in school I would
I would do a similar trick which is find out from the teacher uh what the reading was going to be and then just read all
the books at the beginning of the year yeah that was M it it helps a lot
yeah so uh anyways fast forward uh 2019
I started my YouTube channel uh between that I did a lot of uh different experiments with computer vision I used
to teach uh as a lecturer in one of the universities we used to go for different
robotics competitions and over there I was introduced to drone programming and we had competitions who can run the
fastest drone uh around a path who can run a robot around a path who can solve
the maze fastest so we participate in a lot of different competitions and that really gave me um a lot of experience in
terms of these uh Technologies especially within open CV now uh then I thought okay I will put
all of this together and start a YouTube channel and again in 2019 I started this
and I got a little bit greedy after three four months so I I saw some traction I saw that maybe around a,
1,5 100 people have joined in so I said I want more subscribers so that that
became my focus so what I did was I said I will sit down and try to find one
keyword which basically uh has something to do with all of my videos right one
keyword that defines my complete channel so this was the image that I
actually I saw back then and these are the number of videos I had back then so
when I saw this and I examined each one of these the only thing that I came up with was open CV right so that was was
the only keyword I could find that was directly related to my channel so here I
would definitely like to thank open CV for creating such an amazing library and
making it free because if I were the one making open CV I might not have made it
free right I might have got greedy this this credit the credit goes to Gary
bradsky actually who's the founder of open CV forite 20 years back to uh to make it
open source and you know uh get it running for all these years so definitely a big thanks to him and all
the contributors as well who have made this possible over the years so once I
found out that this is my keyword I said okay I will go to YouTube and that's
what I did I searched online for open CV and I I was shocked to see this it
was similar image that I saw that none of the videos that came up were actual
videos so all of these were actually uh playlists so I said to myself why don't
we have a single course with some projects in it and maybe that will be
something that will hit off right uh take off so that's what I did I created this
learn open CV in three hours and I had nine chapters before so these were the
the blue ones these were the chapters I put them together along with three projects and it took off so it actually
got uh till now it has gotten 3 million plus views so this basically tells you
the trend of what people want right so this was I I call this a loophole that
you need to find a loophole and then you can move on and create something towards
that because that is what people want if you're is getting more views this means
that is what the people want yeah so I tried many different yeah I so one of
the things that it's not very obvious right you have to experiment with some of these formats because you had a
three-hour video yes and exactly you know if somebody had told me um uh that
okay three years four years back that oh three hour videos will be very uh you
know will get 3.1 million views I would have uh just disregarded that right
because 3 hours is a long time right it's a long and but but that is
precisely why you got this these views because it was you know you covered quite a lot in those three uh hours
right so it's it's about the timing as well yeah that if you get in at the right time with the right content but
the question comes why am I telling you all of this why exactly are we discussing uh this um loopholes and
strategies because that actually tells you where the world is headed what exactly is the trend what people
actually want and because that is something that will go we are talking
about the future so that is something that will be carried on in the future so
after this what I did I tried a lot of different things I tried to find a lot of loopholes to see where the trend goes
and how people react to that and one of the videos that got even more successful than this was the Drone programming
course so I I did not actually anticipate this I thought maybe it will
be difficult for people to get the hardware uh it will be difficult to connect there will be a lot of issues
here and there but uh I had something that uh I had experience with that so I
thought why not make a course and upload it but when I see this when I saw the success of this I I truly got inspired
and right away I created another course related to to um drone programming as well and that got a hit as well so
people really enjoy drone programming not just because it is um something you
can Implement in the real world but because it is very good for Education as well a lot of the times when you are
learning programming it becomes a bit dry so if you have something physical
with it like nowadays we have blockly that lets you play with games and create these games then it becom comes very
Innovative and it it becomes very um you would say it's it's about instant
gratification so if you can see something happening from your effort
then you get motivated so that's the basic idea if you can shorten that time
like shorten the time from when you do something to seeing you know the results see the that's how you get people really
engaged yeah engaged exactly so that was the idea that's why this course was so
successful that's why people love doing hardware and software together because
it makes it a fun activity and later on I will show you as well that now even
there are complete institutes that are just teaching drone programming because it is so good for kids to get started
with programming using drones so we will share that later as well so after this
um I tried a lot of different things um a lot of different videos a lot of courses uh some of them worked some of
the courses didn't work as well for example the arino course or the C++ open CV or the face attendance worked really
well other courses like the interactive map course or the anti-spoofing didn't
work as well so this basically tells me where the the world is headed what
people actually want so that's why we focus more on that so coming back to
today now I see a loophole again so I see two loopholes one is the AI course
and the other one is the Drone programming with AI and the reason I say
this is because there's a lot of AI courses out there but the problem is they focus mostly on the mathematical
side the neural Nets how to actually uh create the AI but now ai is not about
creating it's about using it's about putting it to the daily task so that it
helps you as an assistant so when I created my first AI it was back in
2013 it was all about creating so um you you use the neural Nets you create a
face recognition model face detection model and so on but now you don't have to create the model you have to get the
model for example chat GPT or even some of the free ones like Llama Or Mistral
you can get those AI models and you can utilize them to your benefit so that's
what this course uh or or I would say that is what was missing at least that's
what I felt so five days ago we actually launched a course which is AI for
everyone which will teach you complete from the very start in fact if I have no
I don't have it here uh I have a complete checklist of what exactly is in the course and you can check it out as
you go along and of course it is free it's on YouTube and the other one is um AI drone coding that I will discuss
later on we are going to launch it on Kickstarter um after a few days so this
is the checklist of that course now this is the road map to learning AI so
basically first you will start with the introduction we spent a lot of time creating animations to explain what
exactly is AI to someone who has no knowledge of AI whatsoever so there's
introdu introduction to Ai and we discuss some of the common terms that are used in the AI industry we talk
about prompt engineering how effectively you can talk with AI because if you
can't explain what you need you will not get what you want right uh it's called
garbage in garbage out so if what you tell is garbage you are going to get
garbage out then uh we discuss about CP true in many fields whether you're you're cooking or building drones
garbage in garbage out garbage out exactly so then we have a discussion of
CPU GPU online offline how to install and there's a complete section of how
you can do this without coding so you don't have to code you can do it without coding as well but of course when you
are coding we have a section for that we have a graphical interface how do you create these and then we have 15 apps um
some of them include the a caption generator you send in a uh image it will generate a caption for you then we have
an adult content uh detector it would tell you if the image that you uploaded is appropriate or not we have background
remover PDF sorters lots of different apps to get you started up and running with the AI field of course this joke
sorry I have this joke that if you really want to that adult content uh technology to take off you should build
a categorization answer off I'm just kidding that was a joke
that I had okay it's a true it's true so yeah
um so there's all also the training part where you will be able to train your own
model as well and then how do you deploy it so that you can give access to people
and all of that is covered and these are some of the stats we launched it 5 days ago we have over for 2,000 enrollments
again it's free there's no charge and the course rating so far is 99.7%
positive total time it's 12-hour course I know it's a bit lengthy like you were
saying three hour courses are lengthy but now we have 12 hour courses right so
it's a single video uh 12 hours yes it's a single video 12 hours with all the
categorization everything within a single video nice so but of course we have categor CHS that used to be a lot
uh but nowadays on YouTube I mean I watched a three and a half hour review about the video game Doom from Tim
Rogers like that's totally normal nowadays yeah yeah that happens and and I've seen
um a live session of 12 hours I I don't know how people go through 12 hours of
Life yeah they going for a record holy cow man I'm not sure and the watch time so far in these
five days is about 1,800 which is equivalent to watching uh about 900
movies right so that's a lot and people are inside inside
baseball on YouTube uh if I can put in for a second that you know to in order to become a YouTube Partner you need um
I think 3,000 watch hours is that is that what it is per per year so like that one video that one video basically
got you more than halfway if you weren't already a partner yeah that's wild yeah yeah that's true so uh these
are some of the users uploading their um progress so this is the checklist you
just stick it uh as you move along and there is one person who has completed the course as well in five days I I
don't know how they did it they said they will repeat it again I guess they binge watched it and then they want to
try it with the coding part uh that's the idea anyways so our Kickstarter uh
will be 50% off for our AI drone course but we will discuss that later on let's
talk about what exactly is a drone so we get a little bit of perspective of what exactly we're talking about and then we
will move on to where the future is headed because in the beginning we discussed that Amazon has shut down and
um not Amazon DHL has shut down and Amazon is pretty much on the way of
shutting down allegedly right allegedly
okay so what exactly is a drone a drone by definition if you look at that it's a
continuously low humming sound which is a weird thing to say but that is what it
is that's where we are a very popular genre of music among programmers in
fact yes that's true a real thing shout out to S FM for the drone zone Channel
go check that out s FM Som FM okay so uh
yeah yeah so what exactly is a drone we have um a flying unarmed vehicle that is
basically flying and we have lots of different types of these right now we
have uh a few listings here we have a quadcopter we have a hexacopter and
octocopter if you have done High School maths pretty much you can tell why these are named this way this has four
propellers this has uh six and this has eight so that's the basic idea
of this so then we will move on to what exactly are the components of a drone so
we have frame we have Motors we have propellers ESC flight controller battery
receiver and all of these so what we will do is we will look into these very briefly and then we'll move on to the
coding part so the frame itself is what holds everything together it can be of
carbon fiber wood or even 3D printed but the most successful one so far is the
carbon fiber because it is quite sturdy and it is lightweight and less likely to
bend over time as well there's there's many um many benefits it's also unfortunately considerably more
expensive than wood orive a lot of these uh squash rackets and tennis rackets they are now made
with uh this carbon fiber because earlier they used to make it with wood that was very difficult earlier I mean
like maybe 1960s 70s not recently but now they make it with uh
carbon fiber anyways moving on we have Motors so we have brushed motors and brushless motors brush motors are cheap
you can find it in cheap drones brushless they are more expensive they use AC signal instead of DC and they
have a better weight to power ratio it means that um you will have better
efficiency overall when you're using presses that's why most drones they use presses
Motors then we have propellers propellers two of them they will move in One Direction and the other two will
move in the opposite direction and this is because they will cancel each other out if all of them were moving in the
same direction then the Drone would actually start rotating in that direction so that's not what we want
right uh then we have electric motor controller ESC uh this is what gives the
power to the motors and the flight controller decides how much power to
give to the motors based on all the sensor calculations and whatnot so that's basically the brain of the
Drone then a few more components we have the battery receiver camera and video transmitter the video transmitter will
transmit the video the camera will supply the video the receiver will be at the remote control end where you will
receive the video or the signals and then we have the battery which actually allows you to power your drone very
basic stuff that we have uh then we have drone programming so how exactly can you
program a drone now there are two types of drone that I like to categorize uh
this category in the first one is DIY hobby style so what you do is you create
your uh model and you can attach different Motors you can attach
different controllers different batteries and it is basically uh do it yourself get a DIY project that you can
do and you can even 3D print and assemble it all and so on the other category I like to call it plug-and play
so basically you buy it off the shelf and you just start by pressing the
button and that's it now you can start programming so if you are a beginner
then definitely this is much more better for you that you buy something off the
shelf and you get up and running before you go into the more advanced stuff so
let's actually compare a bit of these so that we understand which is better for
which now for drone programming if you're doing with the DIY kit then there
is a steep learning curve you will have to learn about how to assemble the Drone
and not only that you will have to write your own software along with all the calculations and the tuning the tuning
parameters are a great deal for uh flying the drones so you might have
heard of PID and other techniques that you actually have to spend a lot more
time tuning the Drone rather than actually creating it so there's a
there's a very steep learning curve but if you ask me this is the best way to
learn if you want to learn everything from start this is the best way to get started because it is flexible you will
pretty much learn everything uh as you go along the way then uh it is suitable
for outdoor it is not a safe drone you cannot use it I haven't seen uh a small
drone that is suitable for indoor environment that is safe as safe as the
off-the-shelf drones uh then we have uh difficulty for education so it is a bit
difficult to get started because you will get very weird errors and very
weird problems when you are creating your own drone right so I back in uh 2014 I created a CNC
machine and the the big mistake I did I wanted to make it as big as
possible so that's what I did I created it I I believe 1.5 meters long and then
half a meter wide and that was the big mistake because you weren't kidding
yeah I wasn't kidding right so I use the same Motors that you would use for a
small CNC but then the the result was not very good so the idea is that when
you do something DIY you learn along the way so don't expect that you will be
able to run right uh right off and uh everything will be uh you can say
happily ever after right so you have to many drones have you lost uh while learning uh things we have broken we
have broken a lot in fact um I flew one of the drones uh in our University that
I only I was allowed to fly this was the DJI I can't remember it can carry I I
believe 30 kgs so it was a huge drone right and what we did we emptied the
football field and we said okay now we will tie up it with a rope and then one
person will just hold the rope and I will be driving it and looking at the
results because students they will gather right they don't know what's going on they think that you are an
expert in everything right so they will gather and it was so scary I would
actually sweat while flying it off you're like you're like don't don't cut anybody
up don't cut anybody up because that is actually very um you somebody could
could get really hurt from that drone it's it's uh very difficult to handle
that situation anyways yeah um moving one of my favorite movies it's October
Sky and in that they were building Rockets um you know high school kids
right and that also you know you know there was always this possibility of somebody getting hurt um so it's an
interesting movie okay I I haven't watched it I'll definitely check it out October Sky okay
so uh moving on we have the other type which is off the shelf so off the shelf
you can get a drone and you can get it up and running it's basically plug-and play you set up it with an app and then
you can control it with python you can control it with uh Android sdks there's
a lot of flexibility when it comes to coding because a lot of it has been already done for you but where it lacks
is the flexibility so you don't know what exactly is going on inside what are the
controller what are the parameters even the specifications of it you might not know if the company is not actually
telling you so uh that that part is you can say a little less flexible but it is
indoor it is safe so uh this drone I have crashed on my face as well so
hopefully nothing happened getting you should like to know
the parts intimately detor yeah there you go that you're teaching the
courses so well when you are testing it out things happen right right right so
the good thing is it's safe and as soon as it hits you it actually stops and you
don't get hit a lot uh especially they have a rail they have a plastic rail around it and uh it's safe it's not a
big deal and it is very easy to set up for Education you can have for example
10 students with 10 different drones and they can have a competition they can do it for Learning and all of
that good stuff or they can run them into each other's faces
allegedly allegedly okay so it seems my connection
is not good it's not loading the image properly um but is is it readable yeah
it's readable yeah okay so this is what I want to show you how
easy it is to get started with programming with drones so there's a very good Library by the name DGI teli
thanks to all the contributors and the creators of this Library who made it so easy for us to get up and running so
literally with one two and three lines of code I can have my drone running I
can have it connected and I can see it's uh stats so all you do is is it is it a
DGI supported uh one or is it a effort no this is this is a community developed
one it's a little bit I I would say it's a rapper so it's a bit easier to get
working with got it yeah so then you can see you simply write t. you call the
class you create an object and you run that method of connect that's it yeah
that's how simple it is to get it up and running now if you wanted to fly it you would say move forward I mean can it be
more simple than this right move forward and then how much do you want to move forward 30 cmers so all of the the
numbers they are in centimeters so they are mentioning that you move forward 30 centimeters same way you can say move
backwards uh uh flip uh dance not dance
but you can do a lot of these things maybe you can create that method of
dance and it will do something right it will be fun to see anyways so uh this is the basic idea and
then you also have the coding part where you control the speed rather than the
actual value because let's say you were following a line so you will not say
move 1 cmet move 1 cm move 1 cimeter right you would say take a constant
speed when you have to turn change the speed a little bit change add to that speed change things like that right so
that's called the RC control in this library and you can basically change the speed of forward and backwards up and
down uh left and rights and the rotation so you can control four of these speeds
and that's pretty much all you need so that's how simple it is so this code
takes off you can write take off to take off it moves at a speed of 50 for 2
seconds and then lands that's it that's how simple it is to get started with
drone programming now if you want to learn this you didn't even have to mention uh how what is the height of
takeoff there are some default good default values yes there is a sensor at
the bottom that actually uh checks how far you are from the ground and they
have a default value of how far to lift off when you take off okay so if you
want it to go further you can write go up and then then you given the value 10
cm 5 cm and so on got it so that's how simple it is now if you want to learn
more about this uh actually let me show you the example first so here we have a
couple of examples uh this is keyboard control for surveillance the Drone is
taking off and then we are able to control it with a keyboard so I press
forward it goes forward left it goes left so as you can see I can do some
surveillance I can take photos I can record a video and then I can bring it
back home so that's the idea of the keyboard control then we have the face tracking um in which it's not colliding
with by face which is a good thing it means it's working so here you can see
it's detecting the face and then it's keeping a fixed distance uh so that it
is safe as well so this processing the face detection Etc that you're doing on
the on the computer right and you're sending signal back uh to the Drone to
do whatever it needs to be done right yes so this is the good thing about this drone so if you were to take um let's
say an AI model and if you wanted to embed it to this drone then the cost of
this drone will get very expensive yeah so you would need like even a VR right
now if you want good amount of screen you good want good amount of computation
it gets more expensive like the Apple Vision Pro right so this is the tradeoff
that this drone does not process anything on the Drone itself apart from
how to move around yeah what it does it it sends signal through Wi-Fi and your computer actually does the processing so
that's why this drone uh I believe it's $99 yeah9 what's the latency on this thing
um you know when the latency yeah is actually very low uh at if your Wi-Fi is
good it you won't actually feel it and there are a couple of methods where you
can reduce this by adding uh a thread so you have separate threads running
separate processes so that's why you will have a better response so that's
one of the ways anyways so um these are the two projects and then we have
another two projects again all of these are done with the same library with the same
drone using those same commands is just that we added some python code along with it along with open CV code which
allowed us to do this so it has a camera on top of it now the good thing is the
camera if you if you look at the Drone in fact if I have the Drone it's wild to me that these are
just $99 I I can't believe it yeah exactly it's so cheap so the Drone
itself you can see this is the Drone so the Drone
itself you can see has a camera in the front that looks forward right but if
you look at the line following it's pointing down so how is it looking down
so that's the magic of 3D printing so you can see we have a 3D printed part
here which has a glass attached here oh nice a mirror a mirror a miror yeah so
and it's looking down yeah so again we are using open CV with that and this is
simple image processing no Ai No fancy programming just some Contours some area
detection and uh trying to figure out um if you have worked with line following
robots it's very similar to that where you have like five sensors and you check
which one is on and which one is off so the line following Works in a similar manner so it divides it up into regions
which are white which are black and based on that it says this part is on this part is off and so on right quite
interesting I mean uh a simple uh application here uh especially for
educational application you could uh add April tags on the ground right so that it Go markers something Aro markers yeah
uh so that it goes and says oh I'm I'm at number one number two number three so I'm at the right and it goes follows
some trajectory and comth hate hay drone bother moraza just you go over to the QR
code next to so that way the the the thing with that kind of uh approach is
that you know you will not uh uh the the you can you can have arbitrary path
without much work right you could have these patches right you could have these squares you just put the squares in
arbitrary order and uh if uh it is not an impossible path then the drone can
follow yes exactly so in fact uh there are two versions of this drone the one
that I have right now is the edu version and it comes with something like this it comes with these pads which you can
place on the floor oh nice and they all they have some program that actually detects that and you can have a fixed
path okay try to find that and then go left go right you know uh specifically
for for high school or I would say middle school students it's it's a great
way to get started right so uh these are some of the projects that you can make
as well right away because all of this is for free you can go and get started
uh just write drone programming and then this video will show up it's a three-hour course and uh you can see how
lucky I got here three three three if I had only one more three one
more three you know yeah just one more three so did you did
you realiz if I knew this beforehand yeah yeah I realized it later somebody actually commented that and I was like
oh if I had known I would have made it 333 nice and and a bonus we have three
years now okay so so anyways so it's
free for everyone you can go ahead and uh it is using open CV it's free to use
and you can can get started right away and the good thing is that this drone is
so widely available that you can pretty much get it from your local hardware or
electronic Source nowadays it's very easy to find these right but a lot of
people ask me Amazon yeah these days Amazon because I
I I don't remember the last time I had gone to uh any of the actually I I've
been there I've been to Best Buy uh in the last one year but yeah but you you live in the you live out in the BBS
though like in the city you know we've got coal Hardware here in San Francisco I wish they had drones I should I should
suggest it yeah so so that's the good thing about this that you can actually get it very
easily and get started right away without well you will have to pay for the Drone not without paying anything
but yeah so now let's go on to the Future what exactly is the future
because we discussed earlier that Dron are failing and then we had a discussion
of roughly one hour that how to use drones so that doesn't make any sense
right so we will make S we'll make sense of it in a short while okay so the
future what exactly do I personally think is going to happen first of all AI is going to the
drones so drones now will have to decide what exactly is happening in the
environment like we use our llm models we use our uh diffusion models they are
able to uh not the diffusion model but other models that can basically tell you
the semantics of the given environment so once we have the AI running on our
drone it can classify it can detect objects it can tell the situation then
we will be able to take advantage of it a lot more and that's already happening
and that is one of the things we are teaching in our new Kickstarter course how to add AI to the Drone so that you
can leverage that uh capability and imagine you have an AI uh what do you
call personal assistant that actually hovers around you and follows you around
and you just give them the task to do they set it up and you know it will be
quite futuristic to see that quick question in the course uh you're using the same drone that you had shown right
so the uh the AI would be running on the machine the T yes okay and that it has
it has an Intel CPU in there it has an Intel CPU by my understanding is that
correct yes that is correct so the the idea is that mostly it's about the
educational part yeah but when it comes to implementation then of course you can
take the bigger drones and use the same code the only code that you need to
change is how do you communicate with the Drone so the one that we saw earlier
me. connect. how do you do that with the other drone right so that's why I
say that pretty much 80 to 90% of the course is about drones not the T drone
it's about how to program drones rather than the t drone
so why did we say in the beginning that this is not a good idea for drones to
move around and they are shutting down their facilities big companies like DHL and Amazon they are shutting down why
did we say that because they are focusing on the delivery part now delivery is a very challenging task
because not everyone has a backyard where you can just throw something right
people live in buildings people live in small homes and there there's a lot of
region where it's not allowed to fly at all right especially within the cities
uh when you have some confidential areas or uh where there's a lot of air traffic
it's not actually allowed to fly very very big trouble big trouble
yeah so if you want delivery to be happening uh worldwide and uh throughout
the country then you need pretty much access to the whole country you can't just pick and place that okay I want to
do it in this city and not that City uh because when you take the
average um there was a survey in which they asked people do you want your delivery
to be one day and expensive or do you want it to be cheaper but you will wait
two days so most of the people more than 80% of the people said we don't want it
right away we will want the cheaper option and we will want it after two
days right and even in my case if you ask me I would pretty much 90% of the time I would say I would wait another
day uh and I will get the cheaper option so these drones they are not that cheap
to right now to fly and getting these permits is a very difficult task especially in a country like us or UK
where laws are very strict right so that's why it is becoming more and more difficult for these companies to get
these delivery drones up and running right but that's not the end of the world right right so what else can we do
apart from delivery that's the main question so there we have the answer and
for some people it may be you know uh I get my package and the Drone for free yeah yeah like to add a drone to
your order yeah yeah you know there are so many issues like the noise itself is
a big issue yeah the drones they make a lot of noise so when some drone is
delivering in the neighborhood the motor the more noise yeah exactly and then there's an issue of
perfection what what you need to drop off is perfection because you cannot hit
a person you cannot hit a car you cannot just throw it in maybe a garbage b or
even in the bushes right you need near there's also animals out there that may
be interested in the Drone and come up and yeah yeah or maybe in the package
when it's dropped off the an might be interested in the package dep you know
maybe got a big a big shipment of Smoked Meats you know yeah
yeah so so as you see there's a lot of issues so what we can do is a few of the
examples are rescue surveillance agriculture emergency delivery highspeed
Chase and education so what we will do is we will have a brief look at each one of important one I think uh you could
add to the list is inspection so some like windmills Etc they are very difficult to and even Bridges Etc
they're extremely difficult to inspect and right now humans you know they either climb or they're through
helicopters and things like that exactly and that is an important I I guess that would come in the surveillance part Sur
so yeah if you are roaming around looking for something so uh let's talk
about rescue so I'm pretty sure everyone has watched Iron Man one this was back in
2008 so this is the scene from that movie where he got lost he flew and he
dropped out in the desert and he's nowhere to be found so how did he get F uh found using
a helicopter right so they had a rescue operation they actually flew the
helicopter here and there to find the person missing so the same thing could
be done with a drone with much less cost and the similar concept if you are
saying that this is fictional there's a movie by the name 127 Hours have you
guys seen that yeah that's a that is a a very tense movie yeah it is difficult to
watch I would say so the the the movie was that a person he gets stuck in one
of the mountain regions and uh he didn't have any signals yeah yeah and his arm
got stuck now I will not spoil it for you if you want to watch it but uh the idea was
that then they couldn't find him and he had to rescue himself out of there how he did it you can watch the movie but if
we had a drone it might have been easier to find someone who is missing
specifically in these areas where it's difficult to take a car or uh even a
helicopter so that is one of the aspect ects of drones the other one is
surveillance uh it might be of a big house uh if you are rich you have um
acres of land then yeah you can have it as a surveillance drone the other
surveillance goes where you can find out where exactly is a fire when you see
some smoke uh sometimes there are power Cuts in these um power lines and you
have to find where exactly the transmission got cut so all these things can come under the surveillance part and
you can have specific um you can say you can get permissions for that to fly in
that region uh especially in oil rigs and companies that uh do milling and
drilling of these uh crude oil they have huge facilities and when something goes
wrong it can be difficult for them to find out where exactly is the leak and how to get to that as quickly as
possible same with farming and uh you know golf courses is another one where
they care a lot about you know the quality of the grass Etc and if say sprinkler Etc has gone bad and the grass
is drying Etc uh it it you can you can miss out these things can a national
parks and and Parks here in the city like Golden Gate Park especially if like in California they're susceptible to
wildfires like these these kinds of things are really really important for mitigating the damage those types of
events can cause yes a lot of applications uh when it comes to surveillance uh then we also
have agriculture where as Dr Satya mentioned that uh you can surveil the
region you can check where exactly is the crop yielding better where are some of the problems and if there is a fire
or if an animal is moving around all of these things you can basically uh do it
with a drone and then you can have fixed regions and fixed timings that the Drone
flies flies out checks comes back reports charges goes out again comes
back and uh it's basically an infinite Loop you can say uh then we have the emergency
delivery uh let me turn off the volume
because okay so then we have the emergency drone and this is
why Mark Rober was suggesting that this might be the future of drones because
they have implemented this in some uh rural areas so if you see here I believe
this is Uganda and they have this drone this is a company called zipline this is
a drone that actually supplies medical supplies so and it can take off in 90
seconds so when there is an emergency delivery request till it starts flying
there's a delay of only 90 seconds that's how fast it can be they have a
very good facility they are expanding a lot and the way it works is that they
actually pull it back and they let it fly and it goes so fast that if you were
they actually showed this in the video by the way it's a very good video you should go check that out they showed in the video that that it took Mark robber
4 and a half hours to travel the same distance that this drone took only 10
minutes so it can supply the medical supplies very quickly in these rural
areas so when it comes to emergency uh deliveries then I believe it is more
acceptable than I need my PS controller very fast or I need it now right
compared to those those twox XP weekends don't come every weekend man sometimes you just
need a controller right now and it's also the perfect one right first of all PE it's an emergency so you need it
right and these areas rural areas where emergency services are difficult to reach they are also the ones which have
less obstruction right there could be fields and things right so it's yeah yeah for a drone it's easier to fly
around these areas compared to a city yeah definitely and this is an example
of how it throws the package and it bounces off and then it goes back and
they actually have to catch it using a zip line oh wow because it's so fast which is quite yeah it's so fast so they
they don't have a u Landing right algorithm or a landing proper wheels or
something like that you have to catch it with a zip line and you have to pull it back so there's a lot of trial and error
yeah yeah zip line probably yeah yeah probably yeah uh then we have high highs speeded
Chase so uh you can have a imagine a police chase now we don't have a lot of
these here but I believe there's a lot in us so uh there are dangerous high
speed chase yeah so what what happens is that it's difficult to follow along the
the C that has been detected but it might go away somehow so what you can do
is you can fly a drone it can lock that car or whatever it can go under the bridge it can go in weird places and
then it can keep following and giving the exact location and in some cases it
could even throw something which could interfere with the wheels to bring the
car to a halt sure that is one of examples you know not only this I mean
uh for for police but also for journalists so they fly these helicopters when they have this highs
speeed Chase going on uh so it becomes very dangerous because you can actually
the you know it has happened that they've crashed yeah and and you're you're
correct that in in the US I was just reading a a story about this not long ago that I think something like over
7,000 people have been injured in police Pursuits that weren't involved in the US in the last 20 20 years it's not that
it's not that many but years but still like that's those were just those were just Inn bystanders those were just
people that you know police uh put into danger by by doing these chases sometimes so
yeah yeah definitely so uh then we have the
education part so while we have all these uh what do you call agriculture
surveillance rescue examples the best one I believe to get started with is the
educational part that it really makes the programming part very intuitive and very engaging so that
uh engineers and students they get involved right away in this Arena so if
you uh program or if you program without any hardware it's not as fun as if you
do it with any hardware for example a drone so uh I will share a video later
on that will show this inaction where they have an Institute and students are
programming they're having a good time and so on in fact I also did a post a
community post around two weeks back to check uh if people actually prefer
learning programming through drones and you can see 81% said it's more engaging
um 133% said kind of and 6% said no we should stick to uh basic programming so
as you can see there's a lot of potential in education as well okay so now I believe is the time
for the video and uh I I cannot play it here unfortunately so if Phil if you can
play it if I can send you the link and you can play it you got it
okay so let me see how can I send you
here you just post it in the chat here that's fine
so this video is actually our Kickstarter video so we haven't really shown this a
lot it will be launching very soon but because you have stuck around with us a
lot and uh we are going to give you a special sneak peek of our course so this
course is basically about uh embedding AI with
drones and this will be launching very soon in a few days so I
believe you have the link yeah pull it up I'll go ahead and share yep you got
it and after that we can have the Q&A
mhm all right I am sharing it
now so you may have to remove the spotlight
yep okay which tool are you using mza for uh streaming uh the one that's
removing your background and putting uh it's obvious is this uh can people see
this yeah uh did you hear me it's OBS it's the Tool's name is not OB right
he's just using OBS it's OB open broadcasting yeah all right can can everybody see this I'm G to go ahead and
hit play yeah okay thanks 3 years ago I
found a loophole in YouTube when I looked for videos teaching how to program drones I did not find any course
that covered the basics along with some projects so I decided to make my my own course and put it on YouTube now to my
surprise it became the most popular drone programming course on YouTube and with time it became the top search
result on Google as well seeing how much people likeed the first course I made a
more advanced version of this this new course taught more upto-date topics like
making drones recognize faces understanding hand gestures and following body movements people from all
around the world loved it and this became my top selling course on stev's own platform reaching people in over 80
different countries now you might think that the smart move here would be to make another drone course to earn more
money but I did not want to make a new course just for that reason so for the next 2 years I did not make any new
drawn courses but now things are changing with all the new advancements happening in artificial intelligence I
realized it was time for another Advanced course dedicated to this topic so I'm making a brand new course about
drone program in with artificial intelligence this means I will teach you how to make drones smarter like being
able to spot different objects fly through obstacles and do real world tasks and even fly in groups with other
drones this course will include exciting projects that focus on practical challenges such as navigating through an
obstacle course to test precision and control developing solutions to quickly
detect fire in a simulated City environment employ ing AI to accurately count the number of cars crossing a road
and programming multiple drones to create a drone show these projects are designed to provide hands-on experience
with real world applications enhancing your skills in drone programming and AI
technology since conceptual learning is becoming more popular in many high schools and universities these
institutes are now adding drone programming into their curriculum this is done to improve the learning process
this trend has gained so much attention that it has been featured on different news channels there are even specialized
institutes dedicated solely to teaching drone programming whether you are learning on your own or you are part of
an educational institute I will teach you everything you need to get started with AI drone programming there are
three versions of this course the first version is the AI drone Basics here you will learn to build your own AI models
and deploy them to the Drone using the correct programming techniques the second version the AI drone Advanced
takes you deeper into the subject with more complex projects it focuses on real world applications and navigating
obstacle courses with drones the third version is the AI drone educator this
package comes with a teaching license and written material to support the learning process as well making it
easier to integrate this into any existing curriculum each version of this course is tailored to meet different
needs and levels of expertise ensuring that every everyone from Learners to educational institutes can find the
perfect fit for their drone programming education Journey with all the AI courses you will get the free version of
the YouTube drone programming course without any ads if you are starting from the very Basics we recommend to go for
the full pack that includes previous YouTube course and the paid Advanced course and the complete AI course at a
big discounted price I'm very thankful to all the backers of my previous Kickstarter campaign computer vision web
development that raised $36,000 last year I hope you will support this campaign to help it come to
life all the packages are offered at a 50% off exclusively for Kickstarter so
if you are interested in this topic of the future then this is the right time to get on board if you like to support
the project without any backing then please do consider sharing it with your projects to help spread the word thank
you for your support and I will see you in the course
that's a very well made video yeah thank you looks good we' we've made a few
where I wouldn't I mean I think I think we count as experts at this point a like in terms of uh right definitely well
well this a very well made video yeah I agree definitely thank you that's the basic idea that getting Ai and drones
together to actually Implement them with real world applications yeah for beginners as well as for I think uh high
school students uh this could be very very useful yeah I think my nephews
might might be interested in this I'm looking forward to talking with them about it later so when does The kickstar
Campaign launch so uh it will be within this month so we are fixing the date yet
we haven't fixed the date yet so hopefully within this month yeah all
right um I'm looking forward to it and I think you know I'm I'm probably going to
do this for my kids as well I'll buy one of those drones and go to your uh YouTube free free YouTube uh course and
at least get started and then when this thing happens right uh we can definitely the the first thing is to get that video
because it actually tells you a lot so there's no need to go and go for the AI
right away so you have to learn the basics first and then you move on to the more advanced stuff that's awesome yeah
makes sense to me um I think now is a great time to do our our giveaway we've
got uh we've got three giveaways today you like to tell people what our winners will get today
Raza so uh let me actually share the screen uh and let me show you the course
itself so we are giving away our previous course that is paid the
computer vision drone programming
course so it has a lot more techniques some
Advanced Techniques uh that will show you how to do face tracking body tracking how to do gesture control so
for example uh if I do this it should do a certain task uh for example it can
flip or do something else so you can pretty much create games out of this and
have challenges uh for students to try out so that the basic idea behind uh
creating this course so if you can see this is the advanced drone programming
course I'm not sure what's going on with my net so uh yeah so this is the basic idea
you will learn how to detect different poses you will learn how to create a selfie drone body
following uh then basically it is following your complete body then phase
following there's a easy version you would say a normal face detection and then there is some Advanced pH detection
which can detect from the side as well then uh you will learn how to implement
P ID control which is very important and uh not only that we have a library by
the name CV Zone that allows you to plot these uh PID response as well so it it's
very intuitive to see how well your P ID actually performs so you can find units
to get better results so that's the basic idea of this course and um it is I
I I believe it is the number one selling course on our platform at this point
till this point yeah awesome so you will be getting three of these so I believe
Phil will tell you how exactly can you get those that's right so we are going to ask three questions or uh is it do
you think we should take the first three correct answers or do you think we should ask three questions I've got three questions questions let's do three
questions all right let's do it okay of course if you win the first don't answer
yes yes so if you uh if you're just joining us for the first time or you need a reminder one of the things we do on this show every single episode is
give away something to you in the audience our illustrious guest is going to give away three copies of the Drone
coding course that we just talked about there and I'm going to ask three trivia questions to you in the audience in Zoom
the first person to answer each question correctly will win one of those courses
um because this is a special one I think I'm going to remove the Restriction if you've won in the last couple months feel free to answer um but if you win
the first one or the second one do not answer the third one I think that's only fair um so get ready to answer here in
the zoom chat if I say something oh yeah please
do yeah just one more thing uh is the screen visible yes it is yes we can
Spotlight yeah so so if you want to follow the kickstarter you can go to our website which is computervision dozone
and you can click on the kickstarter page so that will open up the kickstarter and uh you can simply click
on uh notify me on launch excent so that you can get notified uh when the course
launches yeah go ahead and share that link in the chat yeah feel free to yeah I will in the
chat okay so get ready to answer um
