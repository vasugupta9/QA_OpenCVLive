CV live this beautiful Thursday morning let us know where you are joining us from in the chat system wherever you're
watching I of course coming to you from beautiful fragrant Soma in San Francisco
California um our guest this week is Caitlyn Gan Caitlyn where you joining us from
today I'm from Southern California um and I go to school in
Newport Beach right on I'm quite familiar with that part of uh SoCal I
lived in Carl's bad for a while um so little bit pretty close closer
than San Francisco anyway um we were talking before the show and uh I thought this was very funny first of all I'm
going to take credit for getting you out of class [Laughter] early this is the my proudest moment on
the show whenever I can get a high school student out of class early it just I get a little spring in my step uh I was I was a high school student once
myself um you're you're in the music room at your school right now actually is yes yes
amazing I think this this tops the time that uh Dustin Freeman was our guest on
the show and he worked at Facebook at the time and he kept getting he kept getting like shoed out of the conference
room he was using and so he kept to like move conference rooms it was very funny um folks in the audience will remember
that but yeah uh good morning hello Kevin from basing Stoke UK hello from to
Berlin hello Winnipeg the United Kingdom Nigeria David from Hungary Steve
from Smart Manion Inc always good to see you Steve hello Richard from
Maine hello from Yokohama Japan hello from France hello East
grinstead they got some really incredible names in the UK I got to give it up the the localities there just just
a beautiful beautiful naming nomenclature they have there um India
Russia Israel Pakistan coming in from all over here on
this beautiful Thursday morning we will get started in just a few minutes here um just going to let people you know
filter into our various chat systems and video streaming services we are live on
Facebook YouTube Twitter LinkedIn and twitch no I am never calling it X I will
die on this hill it is Twitter it will always be Twitter I
agree excellent I'm glad we agree hello Uganda
Mexico Irvine California hello California hello
Madrid somebody in the channel just called me Philly Philly that's not a nickname anyone has ever used for me I'm
not from Philadelphia uh will we be giving certificates for
watching this conference no no you won't um has anybody else noticed the proliferation of these Zoom Bots they're
becoming a bit much we might have to start telling people not to use them like it's fine if one person in the in
the LinkedIn or it's fine if one person on Zoom is using one of those AI summary things whatever but there's like five of
them and it's too many oh hi from Philly to Philly that makes a lot more sense
thank you kha several people agreeing with that it
will always be Twitter I appreciate that uh flattery will get you everywhere folks I think now they're adding more AI
assistance just to make me mad I forgot that I don't run the show the audience runs the show
it's thank you so much for uh reminding me out there
everybody yeah all right I think it's about we can get go ahead and get started here I'll let me switch our
view okay hello everyone and welcome to open CV live I am your co-host with the coost
the second banana who is second to none I'm also your plus one and only Phil Nelson director of content creative for
open CV flying solo today as Dr Sati Malik is flying elsewhere today um our
guest on today's show is open CV AI competition Second Place Grand Prize winner Caitlyn Gan whose incredible
project uses open CV to extract star radial velocities that may contribute to
the detection of Earth 2.0 super exciting but what's most impressive about this is that Caitlyn made this
project while still being a high school student so we are super excited and uh happy to have Caitlyn here um before we
get to the presentation I've got a few things we need to cover at the top of the show the first of which is we are
taking questions from you in the audience please use the zoom Q&A button if you're watching in Zoom or just type
your question into the chat system wherever you're watching across all of our various Myriad channels um we're
also doing a giveaway to you in the audience later in the episode I will be asking a trivia question based on the
presentation from our guest and you out there in the audience will have the chance to win the open CV course of your
choosing you can go to open cv. orgun University to see what courses are on
offer um that's almost it for me but we've got a couple more things I want to talk about here before we get started
I'm going to share my screen real quick and uh show the folks out there so
uh Caitlyn's project was part of the open CV AI competition 2023 was sponsored by uh cottis and Seed Studio
as well as our friends at hackster.io the official Community platform of open
CV um see second place right there you can check out the project here on hater
and uh there's also code there's a very very nice video here that Caitlyn put
together together which um we can uh talk about in a bit um really looking forward to this
episode um did you know that open CV has merch now you can buy open CV t-shirts
buttons pins pet bandanas uh three different flavors of the I love open CV logo on a shirt or
button or bag or whatever we have English simplified Chinese and espanol also this week importantly for
folks out there following the open cv5 live development progress after our Indiegogo campaign earlier or later last
year um we've begun posting weekly updates here on the open cv. org blog
where we'll be able to you'll be able to pop in here after the uh opencv team has our weekly meeting um we take their
notes and turn them into a blog post for you all so you can see where things are going of course you can always this week
we've talked a little bit about uh doxygen We've updated some of our docs in advance the the documentation
software in advance of doing a huge amount of work to update all of the documentation on as part of
the open CV project right now which is you know quite a bit of stuff and uh we're we're really happy to have a
couple have a new extra hand to help on that uh hi to uh gamer
um lots of work on the on the uh deep neural network engine on open CV as well
this week but of course if you want to follow what's going on with open CV you
can always find it on GitHub uh the opencv 5 workboard at uh opencv do or
github.com CV what's be what's a planed to be worked on what's in progress what is
done um you know take a look at uh maybe you'll find something that's interesting to you or that even possibly you can
help out on if you have the expertise um that is about it uh please uh follow
open CV on Twitter we're on Mastadon we're on Blue Sky we are on LinkedIn
we're on YouTube we're on we're not on Instagram or Tik Tok yet I think I'm
gonna have to hire someone about 20 years younger than me to do that because I just I don't know it I don't know it
uh but without further Ado um our illustrious guest Caitlyn Gan Second
Place Grand Prize winner in open CV a competition 2023 super excited to have you on the show even more excited to
have assisted in letting you leave class early welcome Caitlyn yes thank
you yeah introduce yourself yeah yeah so I'm Caitlyn I'm currently in high school
so yes Phil did get me out of class early and I might even miss some of my
next class which is very exciting you're very welcome yeah um I guess a little bit
about me um I'm Kaitlyn uh uh I like I I
like to play lacrosse I'm on my school's lacrosse team um I'm really passionate about like technology definitely open CV
and what I will be talking about today which is like exoplanet detection and yeah overall I'm very
passionate about the stem field so yeah great uh we're so happy to have you on
the show you know one of the things for me personally and I know it's true for SAA as well that one of the reasons we
do this show at all and one of the things that that makes us the happiest is when we can bring younger people onto
the show that you know are maybe just starting their careers or haven't even started their careers yet and you know
help them kind of get their foot in the door but also to Showcase their the enthusiasm that uh folks have out there
for open CV of all ages and it's so exciting to us to see someone that uh is so young and so passionate for this
stuff um and has uh done such really interesting work as such a young age so
uh thanks so much I think we can uh we can get started with the presentation whenever you're ready yeah of course okay so I have a
presentation prepared for you all um it's about the project that I will be
talking about today uh right okay so as we wait for the
slides to start sharing okay yeah looks good okay all right so um this is my
title slide as you can see and essentially my project is using um open
CV to extract radio velocities for exoplanets like detecting exoplanets if
it doesn't make sense right now don't worry um I'll explain it all in my presentation um and yeah okay so the
brief outline of what I will be talking about today in the presentation is um
it's basically presenting my proof of concept research using open CV
um and so I'll start off with a brief introduction and like what planet detection is and how we can use another
method called radio velocity to detect it and then I'll talk about using open CV and essentially like what motivated
me to use open CV and like how I used open CV and then I'll talk about my results for my research and then
conclusions as well as like um like lasting words I suppose
and so throughout my presentation if any of you guys have any questions across
all of the different platforms feel free to message I'm sure Phil will be able to ask it um I'm not sure if I can check
chat yes um but he will be taking my questions for me and I will be answering them you all right yes okay so let's
talk about what planet hunting is and when you think of planets you can think of like um the planets within our solar
system which is like Earth um Mars Venus Mercury and so on so in the ancient
times up until like 1846 we spend like 4,000 years detecting
the first planets all within our solar system right but then in the more recent
40ish years we've detected like thousands of exoplanets and we have
right here it's it's over 5,000 exoplanets and essentially an exoplanet is a planet that's not within our solar
system it might be another planet maybe similar to Earth orbiting a star that is
outside of our our SCE system and so you can see that um in the past we've been
using um like our eyes and telescopes which might be prec like it might not be
the most precise way to find these exoplanets which is why um in more recent years when we moveed to these
like really complicated sounding methods we were able to get much more um like we
were able to find many more planets and so you can see that you have these
different types of Planet detection methods and one of them is the transit
which was developed in 2002 and the other one which I will be like focusing on today is the radial velocity method
and so it's quite notable because it was one of the first methods discovered and
it still U makes up a huge portion of
the number of exoplanets discovered and so now that we understand what exoplanet
hunting is basically we can talk about using the radial velocity method so it's
the one that I highlighted over here got a quick question from the audience here
already um of course what got you so interested in Planet hunting like was
was there something you you watched or uh like what really piqu your curiosity here yeah I was always interested in
space in middle school I did Science Olympiad and I did like the astronomy
event for Science Olympiad so I've always been interested in space and exoplanets specifically interested me
because I was interested in like in a second Earth and it's also really interesting because um I guess like
climate change is a huge like deal in today's world and there's like a lot of
events that like are like significant in
on Earth today right and so we want to be able to like make sure that if
everything goes bad then we also have like a second Earth that we can look towards but it also um the act of
finding a second Earth it's um it's also very grounding because um when you try
to find one you you find that it's like one really hard to find one and two it's probably going to be really far away
from us and as a result we we really need to preserve what we have right now
cuz we can't like a second while finding one would be like really helpful it
might not mean everything essentially it might not mean much at all depending on how quickly things go down the tube as
well um yeah thanks for that answer really really well said um I couldn't
agree with you more yeah and so talking about the RV method we have um it right
here so basically how it works it's also known as the dobler spectroscopy method
where essentially when a star and when there's a star and an exoplanet the
exoplanet exerts some amount of gravity on the host star so as a result when the
exoplanet orbits around the host star the host star will actually orbit around the center of mass of the host star
exoplanet system and as a result um from Earth when we look at this we can see
that the star um comes closer to us when it's like orbiting and then it also has
periods where it's going away from us and as a result when it's coming towards us um there there's this thing called
Blue shift because of the dobler effect and as a result um we will
have the Spectra of these Stars will
appear shifted more blue when in actuality it should it should not be but
when it's going away from us there's red shift because well it's going away from us so as a result because of this blue
shift and this red shift we have these shifts in the wavelength and so using the shifts in the wavelength we can then
calculate um this is the wave this is where the wavelength goes and this is um the speed of light and so using the
shift and the wavelength we can then calculate the radial velocity of the star or essentially like how fast the
star is orbiting the center of mass and so generally when using this radial
velocity method you you basically calculate the radial velocity by
cross-correlating Spectral data with the template Mass so what does this mean essentially you have two um Spectra and
you can cross-correlate them by essentially like overlapping these two Spectra and trying to see where they
like meet and how much the shift is between these two um like Stellar data
and then as a result you can find the wavelength and then the radial velocity and then plot that and then figure out
whether or not there's an exop pan so that's the standard approach um but we
do need to proove this because um the current RV extraction Precision is
around 1 m/ second and essentially to put this into context um for Jupiter um
it would induce a signal of around 12 MERS per second um but for Earth since
it's much smaller even though we are closer to Sun um our mass is much smaller which means that we have a
weaker gravitational force which means that our signal is going to much less um
and so our signal is around 9 cm/s so um essentially what this means is that
since our current Precision is below 1 meter pers second we need to make it so
much smaller for the 9 cmers per second and yeah basically we need to improve
both the instruments and the RV algorithms to be able to achieve such um
a precision and this is essentially what motivated me to do my project because I saw this and I was like oh we need to
figure out a new method that could potentially be able to like make the um
RV signal that we can exract smaller and so this is why I decided to use open CV
for my project so um I'm sure you guys already know what opencv is you're all
in the seminar but basically open CV is a very helpful tool that I used that can
perform precise feature alignment between two images and essentially
adjust the image angle and give you the picture in the view that you want so
essentially um in this example I have here I have a book and then I have like a thing on the book and then I have like
the top view of the book and then so once it detects the features you can then convert it to top view which is
right here and you can see that this is this is the same image but converted into the top view because the star no
the square is still there and you can see that it's um it's visible because we
were able to convert the angled view to the top view through the homography transformation and so we can use this
for detecting exoplanets because if you remember we were cross correlating the
spectral data but if we were to change the spectral data to let's say images of
the Spectrum then we can have essentially two images that we match the
features for and then convert and calculate the shift so essentially um
the example is here imagine we have one like wavelength dip I guess or like we
have one uh uh low here and then we can see that this is at like one period in
time like let's say T1 and then we can see that at 10 10 seconds or 10 whatever
you can see that the wavelength has shifted a little bit and so if we were to stack these images on top of each
other or if we were to use open CV to compare these two images we would be able to um figure out the shift between
the two so that means that the two spectral
images are like basically similar to the two images captured from distinct view
angle okay all right so now I'm going to be talking about like what I did
for being able to use open CV on my images so essentially what you do first
is you build the image because the data
that we're given is not given to us in image form it's given to us in like numbers where essentially if you have a
higher number then will be like a peak and if it's a lower number then it's it's not a peak and so you want to be
able to um basically make these numbers or these data sets that were given into
images so essentially what I did was I just stacked all these values on top of
each other until I created um such an image and additionally um you can also
add noise into this because um sometimes when you're given the data you're not entirely sure what
um how accurate your data is or if it's like 100% correct so if you wanted to
test for um noise or if you wanted to make sure that this would hold up with
like noisy data then you can also add noise by like stacking it on top of each other that's also an option um but for
the um like slides and the demo here I won't really be going into that um but
essentially you build the raw spectral line and the individual line I I know these images look very similar and um
this is why we use open CV instead of just the human eye but essentially this one on the left is a line is a spectral
line where we add the like we add all of
the different time periods together and take the average to build that image and
then this one is just like any random point in time and the reason why we're taking the average is so that we have
like an estimate or like some some period of time we can compare all the other data points to to like figure out
the um radial velocity with respect to this one specific point in time but like
you can take any other point in time but this is just like a um like something to
compare to and so um these two images while they are good images we can't
really compare them yet because um open CV cannot detect the features on this
this um because there's not enough contrast between each individual point because you can see that it's like uh
it's a gradient so it's very hard to detect whether or not there are features
so over here there's zero features detected however if we were to add a foreground mask we would be able to add
the number of features detected using open Speed so um how we did the foreground mask is essentially um I
added like lines to um to the image so you can here you can add lines um like
randomly or you can add lines on like one or more prime numbers so like like
every seven pixels you add line something like that and then um you can
see that when you have um a gradient in terms of the Mask you get more features
so for this you would have zero and then you have one and then so the more features the better um but I also didn't
use random um masks because uh I wanted to stay consistent with my results so in
the end I did not end up using random but um I still ended up using a foreground mask to increase the amount
of features detected so after I added a foreground mask like one one or two features still isn't enough so I used um
the scuti where essentially um now you make the lines much more um clear where
essentially instead of having like a gradient you now have um like fixed
number like fixed intervals which makes it a lot like a higher contrast you can
say it's like a higher contrast and then so um as a result you can see that we
went from Eight Features being detected to 46 features which was a huge increase and very helpful towards my project um
something else that I did was um increased the contrast of the images you can see that over here it's like um it's
there's like one like a small strip of Darkness but when you increase the contrast you can see that there's
there's more dark area and um this is like forly known as histogram
Equalization um which I did use open cv4 but it's essentially just increasing
the cont and then so finally we question from the audience here if you don't mind
um here in the zoom chat uh Ramsey would like to know did you work with any
synthetic data for this project or was this all stuff captured from real life
these are all real data sets um I we'll talk about this more I used four data
sets from like the express um like Pipeline and so um yeah they're real
data sets um and I will show the data later yeah awesome thanks yeah okay
perfect thank you for the question so um next we do feature detection which was a
like um it was a feature of open CV so I use
that for my feature detection and then also this is also under open CV where
you can calculate the homography transformation matrix and essentially calculate the RV shift so um when you're
given the data points you can figure out
the shift between the two points um using open CV and then you're going to
get this Matrix and using this Matrix you can then calculate the shift in
wavelength because you can match the number of pixel shift to the amount of shift in terms of like the wavelength
and then then you can calculate the radial velocity all right so so now that
we have the radial velocity for one point for one like point in time we can
calculate the uh the radial velocity for all of
our points and there are probably like hundreds of data points that we have and
so when we plot this which will I will show later we can see that we can find
some patterns which is very like very cool patterns that we can see
um but the data sets yes so we have four real data sets from the express Stellar signals project and the reason why I
chose these four data sets is because you can see over here we have um various
Stellar activity going on so for example over here um the one I want to highlight
is this one right here because um it's known to have one like Planet like one
fromes confirmed Planet so it's very helpful when you want to like make sure
that your model works because then you can compare this to the um the planet
that you know like exists basically and so you have other data here um do you have a question no I was just going to
pop in to say that HD 26965 looks awesome yeah yeah I I have it as my
Planet yeah I have it as my title card and I have it as my end card because I
like this image so much yeah and then all right okay so here is what happens
when we plot the data and you can see that the radio velocity method or
um the you can see that the method that I created in blue is very similar to the
results from the express CBC Pipeline and so um and by the way the express CBC
pipeline they're like the standard accepted results for the radio velocity
of these exoplanets or not exoplanets these stars and so you can see that wow
they're they're really similar but what does this mean because there's like there's a bunch of dots anyone can put a
bunch of dots on a page but you can see that when we calculate the L Scargo periodogram we can see that the um
computer vision method and the express pipeline results are are very similar
and this is um a lot more like visually significant because you can see that
each of the Peaks match up but it's also um significant in terms of the results
because you can see that the Peaks that we have here are um like they line up
very well and also they correspond to the same period so um we can basically
see so what does this mean basically if you have these Peaks you can see that
over here um I guess on this line this green line there are both we both have a
peak here and essentially what this means for normalized power and like the
height of the Peaks it's the probability that there's a false alarm
or yeah and so you can see over here this line right here the false alarm probability is 1% but if you go higher
than that and find the Orange Line the probability of it being a first false alarm is
0.01 and so that means that the higher you go the more likely it is that
there's going to be a period at this day so you can see that from 10 days to like
an infinite number of days you can see that over here there are Peaks corresponding to like the periodicity of
the Sun so or the star I mean and so essentially what this means is that as
the star um like orbits or has like a period basically um there are going to
be Peaks and then you can figure out what the period of the star is and these
Peaks might not necessarily be attributed to exoplanets since there might be outside factors that go into
the period of a sun but overall you can see that this is quite significant
because you can see that in both my method and the express CBC um results
there's a prominent Peak at 42.4 days which is like right here and
that's very um notable because the star right here has a period of 42.4 days
which is because of the orbit of the exoplanet so you can see that the
results perfectly match up all right and so this is for the first data set um
technically the second one on the previous slide but whatever this is our first data set that we've shown here and
then we also have the results for the second data sets which are very similar as you can see the dots M line up and as
well as the um long Scargo periodogram and then you can see here um it's still
very similar and so what does this mean overall basically we found a very like
robust and like um fast algorithm for
extracting these radio velocities where essentially um the open CV algorithm can
handle both clean and noisy data effectively and it's very robust and
something else pretty notable about this method is that it's it's one of the fastest available methods since it can
process data at one Fitz file per second and essentially a fits file is just the
file um file name and then um and so
it's it's very fast how many how many fits files would you uh
normally have to process to to do this um so each like data point is a
Fitz file so um essentially if you look here there are like hundreds of each of
those dots is an individual file and that's how many you'd need to to process so it it it matters how fast this is is
what you're saying yeah yeah because some I know some other methods they're like one fits file per minute or even
like like more than that maybe nearing an hour so yeah it's a lot slower so one
it'sit file per second it's like very fast and um it's overall a good
sign all right so yeah so what does this mean so essentially um for detecting
radio velocity we're using computer vision Ai and this is very helpful and
it shows that we can use AI for future projects not just for detecting EXO
planets and using our new method we found a close match which shows that
this method using computer vision it H has like very high promise basically
there's a lot of potential and um I'm very interested in exploring more and
trying to test other parameters and see what else we can do to maybe like create
a smaller um to have a smaller um like
value that we extract and then so we can also see that we have a high level of
robustness against um noise and diverse model settings so essentially like if we
change some parameters the overall results won't vary um that much and it's
it's fast and so what this means in terms of like real or like how we can
apply this in real life it shows that we can use open CV and other like art AI
Technologies for other discoveries in the future not just exop Planet but also
other areas than astrophysics so I think it'll be really interesting to see in the future if anybody else uses open CV
for um like astrophysics basically and more exop exploration so um basically
beyond what I've done with the research and the project um in terms of results
I've also um reached out with my project and I wanted to like um basically have
other people also work on it because I think it has a high potential to really
expand our knowledge of detecting exop Panet so to really like get this out
there I've um of course I've um presented or like I've um uh posted the
tutorial on haer and I participated in the open CV AI competition which is why
I'm here and so you have the links there and I also
um presented and published a paper at the i e MIT RTC conference and um it's
on GitHub as well and I am always open to any um comments questions feedback so
you can like find me using my email or with like haer and GitHub I will reply
to the comments and I will see whatever you say and so so um I'm very interested
in collaborating with any of you currently watching like in the zoom or
on YouTube or whatever um basically if you want to collaborate with me on this project just shoot me an email um my
email is on the screen first last and then 77@gmail.com and then
um yeah so essentially what we can do in the future
if you are interested is we can develop chunk by chunk mode um essentially what
that means is that instead of having like individual um like like Peaks that we
look at we look at like a chunk and we also want to figure out like what chunks
are the best for detecting exoplanets because some CH chunks like some of them
like maybe at the start or the end of the spectrum it's it has a lot of noise
and thus is more inaccurate and less um helpful in terms of detecting exoplanets
so that's also an option and then we can also optimize the algorithm um in terms
of using open CV and the image processing and we can try to figure out
more ways to detect features essentially and we can also test on more stars we
can find a bigger data set and then we can also use computer vision or open CV
for other purposes such as like pre-screening the raw measurement data to make sure that we we have or the data
that we have is not as noisy or it it's like better for whatever we want to
accomplish okay and then now um we're nearing the end I want to thank um all
of these people um I want to thank my mentor um Dr Van uh Dr rash paa um I
couldn't really have done it without him um and he provided me the data sets and
all the the overall guidance for my research and also the Yale Express
project because um they have the data and they provided very positive feedback
and of course what I am here for today open CV um because they were able to
provide the open- source CV library that I was able to like create my project
with and also they um gave me great opportunities um and um were able to
like recognize and promote my research finding so I'm very grateful for all these people who have supported me along
the way and that's it we can detect exoplanets together and I hope um you can send me an email and perhaps we can
collaborate thank you tremendous thank you so much Caitlyn
um awesome awesome presentation I think one of the best we've had in in quite some time uh you can go ahead and
unshare your screen there all right thank you thanks so much um much much to
consider uh such a just awesome awesome project we've got a lot of folks in the
in the chat here interested in potentially uh collaborating as well Stephen in the chat says this is one of
the best talks we I've seen on open CV yet so thanks so much we got we've got a
decent amount of questions vasu also says a very nice presentation over on YouTube we've got a few other people uh
saying uh thanks so much um we've got a couple of questions here uh first of all
um so as a as a student I mean normally when we have students on here they're
college students but uh as a as a student
um what do you think is was like the most beneficial to you about um
participating in open CV AI competition 2023 I think the most beneficial thing
is just like the Outreach that it was able to give me and also it helped me
like really try to make my project a lot more clearer like um I essentially like
when I went into this I really didn't think that I was going to win I just thought like a great opportunity for me
to like get my project out there and like share it with more people and then I did win and then it was like an
incredible shock and I'm like really grateful for that and as a result of that it was able to help me like explore
open CV more and also like be able to share with more people basically awesome yeah and thanks so
much to our our sponsors at hater cotus and Seed Studio for that um folks there will be a open CV AI competition 2024 um
we've got a couple sponsors lined up already the best way to stay a breast of that situation is to sign up for the
open CV newsletter that'll be the first place that we um uh announce that when it comes out um couple more questions
here uh so what did did you look at any other data sets um aside from the express ones
or were those really the only ones that were viable for this kind of research yeah so I mostly looked at the
express data sets I used the the four that were um given to me by my mentor um
Al I am open to using more data sets but these were the four main ones that I focused on for my
project makes sense to me um we've got a few people asking about uh like you know
machine learning or uh like recurrent neural Nets or uh long short-term memory
networks uh did you look at any kind of machine learning uh tools for this
project and are you uh if if not or if so are you looking at maybe integrating
them into the project in the future yeah I think that's a really good question um for my project I focused
mainly on using computer vision to um basically extract these radio velocities
but in the future I'm definitely interested in looking at other types of machine learning I think that it will
definitely help expand um how far my project can go and so I'm definitely interested in learning more about these
machine learning techniques awesome uh well said as always I got to say having you having
had you on the show here I am so impressed with how well you're able to talk about this stuff um you uh you have
a you obviously understand it and you're very good at communicating this I think we've had uh a lot of people on the show
who are you know professionals out there that are not nearly as as good at this and so uh we're really looking forward
to to watching your career uh develop and hopefully have you back on the show with some even more exciting stuff um
I'm going to take this moment to do our trivia giveaway so everybody who's been watching out there and waiting patiently
now is your chance um I am going to ask ask a trivia question based on the
presentation from our illustrious guest the first person to answer that question
correctly in the zoom chat and if you're not in Zoom you can get there by going to open cv. Live you've got a few
seconds to do so the first person to answer it correctly in the zoom chat will win the opencv course of their
choosing you can see what courses are available by going to open cv. orgun
University and before I ask I'm going to share my screen again quickly here on the open CV University front there is
some pretty big news today there is a uh new version of our deep learning with
pytorch course this is for pytorch 2 um released by meta fairly recently the
course has been fully updated to take advantage of the new stuff available in the new versions of pytorch and with
this new launch we have a special deal for everybody out there in the open CV Community there is a 50% off
discount excuse me uh that discount was so steep I couldn't believe it um there
is a there is a big discount if you go to open cv. University right now for the
next one day and 15 hours you can get up to 50% off of the deep learning with
pytorch course so please check that out um get ready to answer the question now
if you have won in the last few months please do not answer and give someone else a chance to win out there in the
chat so we talked about a lot of interesting math and science stuff here today um one
of the things we talked about had a pretty interesting name it's a method frequently used in Time series analysis
to identify period periodicities and determine the frequency content of unevenly sampled data everyone out there
in the chat what is the name of that method what is the name of that
method I thought I got you but it looks like Joseph was paying attention uh you're you're pretty close there
buddy um it is not radial velocity no that would have been too easy I'm on to
you we'll give we'll give folks another another few seconds
here before I think we'll we'll give this one to to Joseph donlin Joseph donlin the uh phrase was L scargle LOM
scargle um had not heard that one before sounds like a like a football player from the 1920s Bronco nersi and Lam
scargle used to used to throw down together um congratulations Joseph Joseph please send exactly one email to
Phil atop cv. org that's me and I will make sure that you get the course that you want you can see what courses are
available by going to open cv. orgun University pick one send me an email the awesome opencv courses support team will
make sure that you get access to it right away so congrats Joseph uh we've got a few other questions here
um someone here in Zoom would like to know more about these fits files uh like
what kind of data is in each of these files is it like uh just like some kind
of array of of of numbers like what what kind of info is in a Fitz file yeah so a
Fitz file actually has a lot of information so it's like the standard file that um people use for astronomy
and there's a lot of like data within it but the main one that I used was the the
wavelength and um like
the uh in specific like the berry wavelength which is where it's like the wavelength
but adjusted a little bit because of the like this Earth orbiting the Sun it's
like the Earth also moves so that's why you need adjust it but basically like there's other information that I didn't
use um but it also talks about like um
uh uh there's it also has like the data separated in terms of chunks so there's
like um 86 different orders and essentially each order is like a chunk
of the wavelength um I didn't use all the orders because um the ones at the end are very noisy so I narrowed it down
to like the middle like 40 or so so yeah yeah that that makes sense to me um
I I'd never seen these files either so I was kind of interested in what that might be um we are uh we got about 10 minutes
left here a few more ask a few more questions um I'm going to take this opportunity to remind people that um if
you've made something with open CV recently or just seen something cool that uses open CV send it to us uh
there's a publicly accessible form here where you can send us your cool open CV project or if you just stumbled upon
something on the Internet maybe you found it on Reddit or LinkedIn or Tik Tok or whatever um send it our way and
it uh will consider it for inclusion in both the open CV Community Friday newsletter where we highlight cool
projects from the community and if it's interesting enough maybe you'll end up on open CV live here like our uh
esteemed guest Caitlyn um there's also the uh as I mentioned earlier the best
way to stay up to date on open CV news and information is by signing up for the opencv newsletter you can go to open
cv. newsletter to sign up for that there's a lot of benefits to doing so you'll be the first person to find out
when new courses launch and get the discount codes for those also other opencv projects we give special
discounts to open CV subscribers because uh it really means a lot to us that you
invite us into your email boxes every week um all 92,000 of you on the opencv
newsletter these days um thanks so much for that uh also importantly Google summer
of code contributor applications are open until a April 2nd at 1800
UTC open CV has participated in Google summer of code for several uh of the the
most recent years um Google has been very kind in in helping us with this this program and and giving us these
resources um if you have something you want to work on with open CV or uh just
want to see what's available out there and want to be a contributor you can go to someof
code.google.com register to become a contributor uh pop into the open CV forum and and talk with the mentors this
year and and and see what uh maybe you can come up with something interesting to build we encourage everybody um if
you're a student out there uh please uh contribute uh you know sign up to be a contributor for Google summer code even
if you don't end up working with open CV there might be some other projects that you find interesting for example another
open CV project cat the computer vision annotation tool is also contributing in
Google summer of code this year so uh thanks a lot Google we're looking uh forward to what comes out of this in in
previous years there have been a lot of great additions and uh uh optimizations
made to open CV through this program and we hope that that Trend continues this
year as we uh March toward open CV 5 which again you can stay up to date on
by going to the open CV workboard and checking out the opencv 5 progress
updates which will be on the open cv. org blog every Wednesday
afternoon um open CV is a uh
nonprofit open CV is an open source Library uh we are both of these things
which means that we are supported by viewers like you in addition to the organizations that become open CV
members um if you are an individual out there and you want to support opencv financially you can do so by going to
open cv. orgs support and donating via stripe or PayPal we've also got a member
organization program which uh many of you uh watching the show may be may be
members of already I will uh pop open the web uh the homepage here these are
our current members and partners thanks so much to all of them the most recent is run. we've got um you'll notice a few
new ones here that we haven't really talked about much um but we will be talking about soon thanks so much to all
of our open CV members for helping keep the library alive supporting the community and uh supporting publicly
available uh open-source freely licensed computer vision if your organization
uses open CV and you want to support open CV at an organizational level and become a bronze silver or gold member
you can do that by emailing us on this page as well um bronze is $6,000 a year
you get a lot of perks as a courtesy for being an open CV member organization in addition to having your logo on the
website you'll also be featured at our various trade shows open CV will be at cvpr in Seattle this year um as well as
uh you know being able to engage with the opencv community directly via our newsletters via the open CV live
webinars like we're doing today and all of the other stuff we do with the open CV community so please consider that if

main those are the main ways you can support open CV right now of course if you you can also become a volunteer if
you're a student or a professional or just someone with a lot of time on their hands that knows a lot about computer
vision you can go to uh another form here fill it out to become an open CV
volunteer we're looking for folks to do stuff like uh run open CV groups at their schools um help us improve
documentation help us uh boost and promote things on social media uh as well as
participating you know more more deeply in the community on GitHub and perhaps even looking at you know pull requests
helping with with all of that kind of stuff uh if you're out there uh have a have a look at the open CV volunteer
form and and join us and maybe make something cool together
um that is about it with that I think uhh someone is asking Caitlyn do you
have a LinkedIn account oh I do have LinkedIn okay so if you another another
way if they want to uh professionally collaborate um we drop those links send
it yeah should I send it in the chat now yeah go ahead um we'll also drop those
links in the show notes for everybody watching out there after after show day
um any any final thoughts uh for the audience Caitlyn you thanks so much for
this awesome presentation this is uh already one of my favorite episodes no thank you for having me on
this show I'm really grateful that um I was able to participate in this competition and
and ultimately do very well so thank you so much yes the pleasure has been all
ours and thanks so much to you out there in the open CV Community we wouldn't be doing these shows if you didn't watch
them and share them with your friends uh thanks so much for joining us on this Thursday like so many of you do every
Thursday morning congratulations to our trivia winner um next week Our Guest
will be quaba aumen of uh open MV the open camera uh manufacturer there's been
a lot of interesting stuff going on in the world of open MV recently and we're looking forward to getting the update on
that Open Source Hardware and software um really looking forward to talking with quab he's been on the show a couple
of times he's actually lives in my neighborhood and somehow for some reason we never see each other unless we're doing a show like this so it will be
good to catch up with quaba um we hope you'll join us for that um and then the
the week after that we have Bart Bart T
I'm not going to try to pronounce his amazing polish last name but you'll remember him from uh building Sports 2.0
an episode that we had a while ago as well as participating in a previous version of the open CV AI competition
where he made a really awesome laser tag uh VR type of thing using open CV AI kit
uh so look forward to that Thursday morning 9:00 a.m. same bat Time same bat
