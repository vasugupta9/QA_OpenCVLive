joiners I see I see Albert Baldwin like every single morning hey folks welcome
howy everybody yeah welcome for making time yeah please everybody uh let us know where you are watching from
wherever you're watching us YouTube twitch Twitter Facebook Zoom etc etc I am coming to you from beautiful fragrant
Soma in downtown San Francisco California and our guest this week is quab and auman quab where you coming
from I'm coming from beautiful fragrant Soma also that's right I I could probably throw a rock if I really you
know cut got the wind a little bit and it might hit you but yeah Bill lives a block away from me that's right hello
Brazil hello Madison Wisconsin hello London hello
Liberia I think we've had a Liberia pop up in the chat yet I'm uh I'm excited
for that welcome folks hello Vancouver good morning as always Steve
from Smart Mansion Inc in Toronto hello Rustin Louisiana
hello Florida Canada India Palm Beach Florida Oman
Greece Munich Holland Smithfield
Virginia Samuel coming to us from Toronto on YouTube here we are around
the world we just need someone from Australia indeed Richardson Texas medin
Colombia Oman hello everybody we really do
appreciate you joining us here on this beautiful Thursday morning here on Al
Gore's internet got quite a few folks from Germany this morning hello
Germany this is going to be a fun one we've had uh quaba on the show a couple of times here but um you know we're GNA
we're going to talk about a little bit what's what's new and a little bit about the sort of history of open MV and um
maybe give you some some tips and tricks on on your own entrepreneurial
Enterprises and things like that for you folks out in the audience um as always uh don't forget
that we're taking questions we will get the show started in in just a moment we'll give folks a little bit more time
to see that we're live and and pop onto the YouTubes and the and the LinkedIn
and whatnot we're currently setting at 65 here on the zoom chat doing a quick
survey over on LinkedIn what do we got 25 over on LinkedIn we got eight on
YouTube couple people watching on Twitter we're never calling it X on this show got a couple people watching us on
the face works that that's my Hill I'm I'm I'm
taking that one to the Grave yeah I just it's it's the naming is is a one letter
I know I know someone likes that but it just it's too it's embarrassing it's embarrassing
the guy's like 60 years old come on man like why didn't he just call it extreme or something Fu okay um got AI
assistants joining now yeah there's there's a flood of them uh please folks like if I I know that you like the AI
assistance but we only need one per meeting like I'm I'm going to have to start kicking people out of here for
doing this because it's taking it's taking uh too much too much Focus away from everybody else um
but uh yeah so I think let me now is a a good time for us to get started
so hey out there everybody Welcome to open CV live I am your co-host with the comos the second banana who is second to
none I'm also your plus one and only it's Mr Nelson if you're nasty but you my dear friends can call me Phil and we
are here this week with quaba aguman the founder of open MV who makes amazing low
cost low power cameras that that have python inside for
microcontrollers they've been around for several years we've had them on the show a few times and we're looking forward to a catchup um fun fact quavana lives one
block away from me um so we we could have done this interview in person but due to extreme laziness on my part we
are not speaking of extreme laziness Dr Satya Malik is not joining us today I'm
kidding he is on assignment he's traveling we will have the good doctor back next week hopefully um but uh who
knows uh the the busy life of a CEO something I'm sure that uh Our Guest is well familiar with if this is your first
time joining us or you just need a few reminders one thing we do on this show every single week is take questions from
you in the audience use the zoom Q&A button or the chat system wherever
you're watching to ask questions during the show we'll do our best to flow them into the conversation we'll also save
some time at the end of the show to try to answer questions that we have not gotten to we're also giving something
away to you and the audience on this episode of open CV live like every episode later on in the show I will be
doing a trivia giveaway one question the first person to answer it correctly will win the open CV course of their choosing
you can see what courses are available by going to open cv. orgun University
even if you don't win today check out opencv University maybe invest in yourself this year up skill get the new
job you want get paid more at your current job uh open CV University can help you do all of these things if you
put the work in um before we get started proper with presentation I've got a
couple more little bits of open CV business I want to discuss up at the top here we're coming up on some deadlines that folks need to be aware of uh one of
which is Google summer of code um open CV has been uh honored to
be selected to appre to participate in Google summer of code for uh the the
last many years and we really do appreciate Google giving us that support many awesome things have been added to
the open CV Library as a result including huge updates and uh improvements to the DNN module in
previous years um I believe uh some some barcode scanning optimizations were added last year
um uh regardless uh Google summmer code contributor applications are open until
April 2nd um if you are a student anywhere in the world you can go to summer of code. withgoogle
and you can apply to work on some cool open CV projects over the summer also uh
this year with Google summer of code the computer vision annotation tool has uh been selected and so maybe if uh open CV
is not your bag you want to work on improving cvat another great open source tool that many people benefit from out
there possibly including you watching this right now so go check out Google summer code um apply if you're if you're
passionate about this stuff um looks great on a resume and you will get some uh highquality mentorship from industry
professionals which uh for folks that have been in the industry know that it's tough to get a lot of these people's
time and so being able to to actually you know interact with them and and and learn from some of the the top names in
the the field of computer vision and AI is uh an opportunity that does not come very often so please uh check it out um
we've also got the open CV workboard open CV 5.0 is is in progress we are uh
every day the team is working on uh features for the biggest release of the biggest computer vision library in the
world you can see the todos what's being worked on what's done we're also doing um blog posts on open cv. Org
summarizing the changes every week uh this week's update will come after the show in fact um lots of uh lot things
are starting to sort of uh snowball here and and really get rolling after a few weeks of you know doing a lot of the
background work that is required before you really start crushing code and the team has uh yeah really started going
here we've got 20 closed tickets uh obviously the best way to follow this is to go to the GitHub workboard it's
github.com orgs opencv uh you know stay stay AB breast of the of the updates and
and how things are going whenever you want by checking that out um open CV is a nonprofit organization that makes an
open-source computer vision Library if you've got a few bucks to spare you can support opencv directly financially by
going to open cv. orgs support and donating via stripe or PayPal open CV is
a 501c3 registered nonprofit organization in the United States which
means that if you are in the US and you donate it's very likely that you can claim this on your taxes so uh if you
send us a donation hit me up fill atop cv. org and uh I can probably send you a
tax receipt um it won't help you on this year's taxes obviously but because I'm sure many of you are in the painful
process of doing this year's taxes or this quarter's taxes if you're a freelancer like myself uh you want to
make sure that you you do your best to make next year's pain just a little bit less and you can do that maybe by giving
open CV a couple of bucks if you're part of an organization that benefits greatly from open CV and you want to contribute
to open CV to keep us to keep the lights on in this little nonprofit organization we have here we've got three levels of
sponsor ship for organizations there's bronze at $6,000 a year silver at $30,000 a year and gold at $100,000 a
year this gets you uh quite a few perks for example appearances on opencv live
blog posts on open cv. org we will uh help Syndicate your content to the engaged open CV audience pending
editorial approval of course it's me I'm editorial approval um so check that out
if your organization uses open CV and wants to wants to give back a little bit to the community even if you can't give
back financially maybe your organization has significant engineering resources and you want to devote some of those
resources to help work on opencv that would be rad as well um please send an email to Phil itop cv. org if that
describes your organization and we can talk and and see what we can do together thanks so much for considering becoming
an open CV sponsor you can also sponsor opencv on GitHub you can go to github.com sponsoropen CV and for $9 a
month month you can join the 12 incredible human beings who are currently supporting open CV on GitHub
that's a new record by the way 12 excellent I love it um thanks so much everybody out there for doing that uh
you can also buy a t-shirt open CV's got swag now we've got merchandise folks uh t-shirts buttons pins uh tote bags pet
bandanas I'm deeply deeply disappointed in every one of you because I have not received a single photo of a pet in a
pet bandan yet get on it get on it um you can also become an open CV volunteer
open CV is building out our volunteer program if you're a student or a professional or just some person that is
uh you know a freelancer building their own cool little uh open CV based projects um maybe you've got a couple
hours to spare every week maybe you want to help uh promote open CV maybe you want to help us with documentation maybe
you want to uh help organize an open CV Meetup at your school these are all great reasons to become an open CV
volunteer please uh check out the open cv. orgs support page for a link on how
to become an opencv volunteer um if you're watching this
anywhere else opencv has a YouTube channel youtube.com/ opencv official
this is where you'll find the recordings for every episode of open CV live we're also on LinkedIn we're
streaming on LinkedIn as we are on YouTube we've also got blue sky we got we got the new stuff out here folks
we're not stagnating on on the the failing Twitter platform we're on Blue Sky we're on Mastadon we're on LinkedIn
we're everywhere um with that I think now is a great time to pitch to quavana
quavana welcome to the show please uh you know tell the folks who you are and give us a little bit of history of open
MV it's it's really impressive what you've been able to do with a like a very very resource constrained I feel
like you you you're you're kind of amazing H thank you yeah resource constraint just just me and my
co-founder really working on this uh platform now for quite a long time but with uh some success and you know
improving momentum so I'll get started hi everybody uh I'm quaba uh I run a
company called open MV and we've been doing a computer vision on microcontrollers for about eight plus
years now um actually longer though because uh before I got into open MV I
was doing something called the CMU cam I built the CMU cam 4 uh back in the day
if you ever remember the CMU cam sensors these were the first like microcontroller computer vision sensors
and they were they were released back in uh 20 uh 2000 more or less um way way
before like you know Arduino or Raspberry Pi like had you know existed
in some cases but definitely before there were camera modules at at that you know uh that size and and for MCU oh
yeah absolutely these things were running on I think a XX 48 or something it was uh seriously an 8-bit
microcontroller architecture uh I remember looking at the system and it's it's so simple compared to the mcus we
now deal with um it's a it's a cool job running this company and and doing stuff
on microcontrollers because uh these these little processors have gotten ridiculously powerful actually um uh
lately uh they're actually kind of coming on the I I think about my um my
first computer where I played Starcraft on and that now fits in a $4 chip basically uh that's kind of the level of
silicon scale that's been happening uh you know Pentium 3 processor uh with all the SD ram and everything you had and
hard drive now that's that that's a whole embedded system this big um so I've got a presentation uh to share so
let me try to switch over to that um just to to get it started okay sounds
great all right uh can you see my presentation is coming through I can see the screen we're coming through Demitri
okay great uh which one do I that's a Doctor Strange Love reference for yall out there ah all right open MV uh so we
make we make something called the open mvam and we are developing a computer vision Library like open CV but our
focus is on embedded systems that have no operating system so bare metal um you
know pretty much uh everything is just running total control um on the system
and these are for microcontrollers that are small computers in everything so um our most recent product
is the open mvam RT 1062 built on a cortex M7 processor and this is a 600
mahz CPU with 32 megabytes of SD ram uh again fun fact Windows XP that's the
minimum requirements you need to run Windows XP actually so could this run Windows XP potentially um would you want
to try to make that happen though probably not but uh it definitely can run Doom um anyway so you might be
underestimating just how much I love and miss Sid Meers Sim
golf probably could put Sim City on it definitely it doesn't you know this is one of those things I'm going to hijack
for just one moment uh I think a lot of people are familiar with wine the the the windows compatibility layer for for
Linux and and and Mac OS there's some games that because of the way that they were developed at the time they do not
work still on wine and you have to basically have a Windows XP or Windows
2000 in stall to play them one of which is Sid Meers Sim golf one of my all-time
favorite games so for a while I had a little you know uh desktop like Packard
Bell computer just to play that game in my apartment that's a lot of work to maintain you know especially since
computers sometimes randomly die when they get the heart the Heart Wants What It Wants man that's true um all right
anyway uh to continue yeah so what we do is uh basically it's a full computer vision live Library similar to open CV
uh mainly just like the image processing module um not not necessarily all the extra algorithms uh we try to fit
everything actually within to about two to four megabytes of flash Bas so if you if you think about that yes you can you
can do most of the algorithms on open uh open CV within two to four megabytes of flash uh because at the end of the day
most of them just have really tight loops and aren't actually a lot of lines of code in particular um the the thing
that the things that are huge are the data structures that you need to store like um you know ml models that that's
where you start using up a lot of space real quick um and then you know one thing we've been doing uh which is
definitely new for folks of the microcontroller world is actually trying to do simd optimized coding uh so a fun
fact um a lot of these mcus that are out in the world they actually support uh
something called cortex simd um uh instruction sets and this allows you to
do two instruction s per clock sometimes up to four uh it's it's very limited
compared to desktop simd but this is widely deployed on billions of mcus and
this actually lets you get you know again you know two to 4X the performance on these microcontrollers uh but uh it's going to
change in the future because arm just released uh this new processor called the cortex m55 uh they came out with it
back in 2020 but uh it's finally made its way into chips now this year
and uh basically microcontrollers are going to have Vector DSP instructions uh similar to arm neon so this is about a
th000 new instructions to the instruction set and this actually improves the processing performance from
you know two to four uh data values you can operate on a time to up to 16
actually um and so just think about those as like clock multipliers so that 600 MHz CPU I'm I'm showing you is
actually you know 1.2 gigahertz and then once you bring in the uh you know the uh the neon well the the
new helium instruction set for new systems that 600 megahertz will you know
be multiplied by eight then and so you're really getting into you know application processor territory in terms
of performance but uh still on a MCU that's bare metal um where you control everything directly um now why are mcus
interesting well one of really impressive how quickly um I feel like the last couple of years the the
efficiency of these processors has really like kicked off I'm building a little Cy deck project in my spare time
just based on the pi 02 and holy moly like it's wild how fast that thing is
for like $10 um and you know I've got a heat sink on it so I'm not worried about thermal
issues or whatever but I mean you can really text like that thing will run on a very small battery for hours and hours
and hours you know pretty good pretty good speed like you can play some it definitely runs Doom oh yeah
you could you could probably run you know seven or eight Dooms at a time on this little guy it's it's incredible but what if you could do it
without a heat sink that's that's the promise of microcontrollers uh they uh you know
you're drawing something on the order of 100 milliamp and the newer ones that are even faster surprisingly they draw less
power thanks to just lower voltage rails and such um so you're looking at like 20
30 milliers for you know the even more performance which is just a tiny tiny
amount of electricity like I don't folks that you know they might can you can you
think of a good way to describe that to people like the the comparison because if they're not electricians they you
know or uh Engineers they might not get just how tiny that is yeah yeah um let
me think let me think what's a good comparison um well okay so let's do wattage like
your your standard laptop is 65 Watts power adapter and so this is one this no
this is less than one this is like .3 Watts or so so that's the that's the best way to think about it your computer
needs 65 this needs .3 so it's it's a it's a couple orders of magnitude and
difference wow but uh that's actually really important next point I wanted to
mention is the uh the power draw in deep Sleep is where we've been seeing a lot of people really interested in these
products uh particularly it's it's this kind of superloop people want to do where they want to have something that's
on a battery it's in a really low power state and then an event happens it wakes up into a higher power state it takes a
picture it does some ML on that picture to figure out you know what's happening and then it would transmit that image to
somewhere else and then it goes back into sleep and that's where we see a lot of people looking at this technology for
that reason um and to help enable that to transmit the image somewhere we really built in a lot of connectivity so
ethernet Wi-Fi Bluetooth USB uh spy bus I squ C so everything you need to really
get to wherever the heck you're going with that data one of one of the great use cases for that what you're
describing here that we've seen in in previous open CV competitions and and even in the news is is conservation like
uh uh basically like spotting poachers and things like this in various parts of
uh you know like Africa and and other places in the world where there's not a ton of people around not a ton of like connectivity or or ways to really do it
and it's also kind of dangerous you know for for humans to be just kind of out there number one poachers don't like
being caught uh number two those animals are big and you're kind of on their Turf
um and so this this sort of thing is is really essential to a lot of um you know environmental concerns and improvements
that we as technologists can bring to the world so it's really awesome to see oh yeah no definitely we actually have
quite a few customers who are actually using the open MV cam in that way because it kind of is a direct fit for them um the the low power point being
the most important uh it's it's a it's a challenge when you need need to so when I say we can go to microamps of power so
when you when you go to the microamp level a a battery
uh let's see at the microamp level a battery this
big will last you five years of runtime it's nuts in low power mode so when
people talk conservation cameras they'll load it up with maybe a you know 20 or 30X this much battery power and you know
pretty much you'll have a system where you can deploy it and realistically 5 years later come back and it'll still be
on that same battery that's wild like it's it's interesting because on some of those batteries that the that's actually
beyond the expected lifespan of the battery like it'll never it will never complete a full discharge cycle in its
life that's kind of interesting yeah though that's the that's the goal if you actually want to have something deployed and it it's it it's what's interesting
about uh these types of applications is it one of the things to understand is when you have a large amount of power
consumption you have to actually link yourself to typically to some power input source uh to get power um Poe for
example might be a way to do that but um Al so I'm I'm the president of my of my
HOA where I live and I didn't want to be the president it was just there weren't that many owners in my building so I got
signed up by the all other HOA members and it it basically means I act as a super for free you know fixing light
bulbs and other stuff and most recently you know the garbage uh can overflowed and someone had to go into to the
garbage room and pick it up um so it's not a it's not all a fun and games job but uh one of the things that uh I I had
to deal with was we needed to add some security cameras and just like doing the quoting for the security cameras uh
guess what the security cameras themselves were $100 each and it was $5,000 to run the conduit for the E
that's pretty that's pretty common pricing yeah yeah and uh you know when you think about that you realize uh you
know when you have to build out infrastructure in the real world for actual systems uh it cost a lot of money
especially you know labor for folks to do custom stuff like that to just run metal conduit with uh with ethernet
cables you can actually end up being like just the cable itself and that conduit can end up being you know much
more expensive than the sweet Hardware you designed that's supposed to be sexy and do something you might just be not
unable to complete the project because you can't actually get a ethernet cable and power to it easily um looks like we
got some questions in the chat oh no nothing's there okay cool not yeah keep going okay keep going so uh why am I so
excited about this uh I'll tell you one thing so I used to be uh parttime on open mvy uh just basically side hustling
this for the last uh seven years basically so you know it's a dream hey
we like playing around with these things they were cool and then people started being interested and then I started working harder on it and we've been
optimizing code and going for a long time and you know they're actually starting to get pretty decent like our
performance we're pushing these processors to the limit uh I'll say this we've we've actually made our current
system like four times faster with the same processor just by one you know better frame buffer architecture so
we're not dropping every other frame instant 2x you know frame rate boost then dma offloads where the CPU wasn't
capturing each line of pixels at a time so freeing up 50% of the processors performance so doubling again and then
you know learning how to write algorithms better where we don't waste a huge amount of CPU time redoing the same amount of work and then adding um simd
performance to algorithms and it's just been you know if you look at our code base um from you know five years ago uh
the same Pro you know the same micr controller the same uh Base Hardware system will be on the order of 2 to 3x
to 4X faster with just code changes and it's it's crazy that you can have that much performance by just being better at
understanding what you're doing well and that's also I think you know an important difference between those are
the kind of gains you really only get when you're not part-time when you're like kind of all in because you have the
time to do it or you're taking the time making the time to do it and uh so it's it's really awesome to see yeah yeah no
it definitely is um I did a lot of those part-time but that's what's setting me up to think about doing it full-time now is is is realizing you know I thought
these things were just slow and whatever you know it was cool that we could do this you know kind of coding but then
starting to realize that they could actually be competitive with application processors is the it's it's kind of the
Insight that makes me want to go full-time on this and give it my all so that um we can see what happens uh and I
say this is important because microcontrollers uh they're kind of big you don't think about them often but
they actually Eclipse Linux based processors significantly um it's it's a $44 billion
Market well will be in 20130 um in 2022 3.2 billion of these things were shipped
now of course all of them weren't like high-end devices like a lot of them were like a microcontroller in your remote
but uh they are literally everywhere um I mean if You' if you've ever used an Arduino to Blink a LED you'll know what
I mean like that that used to be a 555 timer yeah people put a lot of effort into designing electronics and nowadays
the thing is throw a microcontroller on it write some code microcontroller does the thing um you know no one's doing uh
integral like PID control using op apps anymore like they did back in the 70s that's that's not a thing and in many
cases it's cheaper to throw a microcontroller at it than to buy a 555 timer chip oh it is it's cheaper easier
it's just you know this is the nature of things uh people use mcus everywhere and if you need one that's hardened and
radiation tolerant or whatever for some crazy app you can do that too um the lower mcus are fine for you know
applications where you say I want to do everything in analog um anyway so historically these have been basic
processors you know they just had like eight bits of performance and Etc they weren't that interesting um but not
anymore um you know the latest ones coming out in 2024 like at the 16 nanometer finfet node uh they got
megabytes of RAM on board that run at uh gigabytes a second like you'll have a 800 megahertz System bus that's um
running at uh 128 bits at a time uh 128
bits to 64 bits at a time on some mcus and that's giving you um 3.2 to 6 gabes
a second or so bandwidth on the microcontroller and that's drawing you know micro that's drawing milliamps of
power um and if you can fit your application by the way into that internal system Ram you don't need SD
ram anymore which cost a lot of power like you know ddr4 Ram is not uh it's uh
it's pretty power hungry and it requires board space um and it's one more thing that can fail yes that's true uh you
also have megabytes of flash on board some of these mcus uh not all the case uh not always typically they try to
locate it externally to do execute in place but there's some that have megabytes of uh flash or Flash
equivalent let me not say it's flash uh I think it's flash equivalent at the that lower uh when you start getting
into that uh that that fine node process geometry um but they're also including
um neural network accelerators this is the big crazy thing uh so there's stuff
arm has uh they're releasing this m55 core that has Vector dsps so it can do
you know 8 to 16 uh values at a time of simd um and then uh again they're also
putting though ethos u55 uh ml accelerator and so this gives you something on the order of 200 to 600
gigaflops of performance uh this this actually you know Raspberry Pi 5 full boore all core is running at maximum
you're at 100 gigaflops um and that's yeah and drawing uh you know all the power uh with a huge
heat sink on that and you'll have microcontrollers that are going to draw almost no power outperforming it um
that's not to say that you know the next version of the Raspberry Pi can just include a specialized accelerator uh
which would very easily get it to that level of performance but uh you're seeing these things now coming down in
chips that are going to be on the order of $4 or so um and uh even better uh
specialized Hardware now um for actual image stuff so you want h.264 on a mic controller other stuff like that uh I
don't know I mean who knows what's going to be happening um but you know vendors are starting to release uh things in the
future for this kind of stuff we see it everywhere uh it's definitely H it's definitely been happening you know in
China um from other various IP vendors and such and so uh 2024 and and 2025
we're we're going to see these things coming on board um and so this is where open MV comes in uh there's no
standardized library of software for all of this stuff it's kind of like hey uh you know there's SDK rewrite it
yourself figure out your own application fight all the dma controllers um you know there's something called Cash
coherency you have to deal with uh which is something that's very very brutal if you don't understand how machines work
at the lowest level uh lots of great gotas and issues and so uh open MV
really we want to be that uh software library to kind of make that easy for folks which it it's kind of like a open
CV mixture but it it includes a focus on camera drivers processor drivers kind of
the whole K you know the whole kitchen sync so you can just focus on writing some code versus having to build an
entire operating system from scratch see we got a question so far
yeah I see that we've uh so uh Antonius would like to know uh a little bit about
Arduino uh compatibility with open open MV and um asking about C or C++ code
with open MV yeah yeah so we're actually uh we have a whole all our code bases in
C but we're built on something called micropython so it is not a Arduino programmable device uh there's a reason
for that uh the the firmware images we ship are on the order of a couple megabytes or so to run the whole thing
and so if you think about the Arduino s programming experience you'd be uh reflashing a couple you know megabyte
large image each time you want to make a change uh instead with micro python which is also a pretty popular uh system
nowadays it's uh you just send a python script that kind of high level tells the system what to do and um one of the
things to note about that is uh you can write algor like our
firmware is totally open source so you can go in there and do all kinds of crazy stuff whatever you want but we have like the easy mode layer which is
micropython um and using python is really really valuable just you know data structures dealing with Malo free
all that kind of stuff that would be really nasty right um if you had the you know if you have like a image function
return a list of objects that you have to manually garbage collect yourself uh that that that'd be a lot harder for
most people and so python just lets you you know easily forget about that and you know garbage collection will run and
clean it up for you yeah micropython is great um I've I've done a few projects
with circuit p and and a couple of other uh just being a python guy in general and you know open CV has a very popular
python uh flavor of the library as well um it's uh really great to just be able
to directly Port that knowledge over into working on a completely different system which is one of the you know
great I think one of the great things about python uh in general yeah no absolutely uh what we see for our power
developers is that they try to like go between the python and C um so we have a lot of users who just stick in Python
and ask us to fix bugs but for anyone who's like I need to get something done quickly they actually like that hey I
can get started in Python it's easy and then when I run into some issue I need some help on or I need to customize the
system you can just dump you can just jump into the firmware and start editing things as you feel like um and it's it
it makes it nice and easy to to kind of play with um I just wanted to I added this slide it probably is too much
detail but this is the this is kind of like why I see this wave coming um uh
furthering on that previous piece of information I was talking about microcontrollers becoming these superpowered systems nowadays uh it's
kind of like you can have one chip to rule it all so uh what if you can if you're building a system what if you can
save on your of materials by cutting out the need for extra RAM and cutting out
the need for having an operating system and a hard drive uh what if you could save on Space you know physically you
need board space on a PCB to say you know to add those two chips and then what if you could save on power
consumption uh that's kind of where we see uh this this trend going with these superpowered mcus is that uh when you
shrink your application and you just make it really focused on doing that one thing it needs to do you're going to be
able to unlock these three different Savings in one go and um I I I believe
that that's going to start really changing things in the embedded world over the next 10 years and so that's
what I'm excited to see on how that shapes and unfolds got another
question yeah I see one here um Naser says tensor flow in a microcontroller it
looks killer could you elaborate please oh yeah yeah actually so Google released tensorflow for microcontrollers a long
time ago um we work with a called Edge impulse who uh basically operationalized
that so they um they started off with uh like pretty much the guys who helped generate tensorflow for microcontrollers
all left Google and then basically went to work at Edge impulse and uh more or less they are the company that helps you
do like a they have like a roof flow like pipeline where uh you basically upload your image data you train a
neural network online and then you download it and you can just load it onto the system and it can run it can basically we have a tensorflow library
on board and so that execute the neural network and um what's nice about that is the tensorflow library in the future can
directly utilize these uh you know hundreds of gigaflops neural network accelerators so on our current system
you you may not be able to get the the maximum performance you can get just because the it's everything CPU done but
in in future systems you'll have that accelerator just turn on instantly and you know 100x performance um on a
different platform uh yeah um I think uh we got Phillip here yeah Philip would
like to like to know just just Philip says they're just starting out with computer vision uh do you have any
suggestions for for projects to uh that are sort of forward thinking like toward
2030 any any projects for someone new in computer vision to you know how can they
prepare themselves for what's coming next versus what we have today what's coming next versus what we have today
well my focus is mainly just on the cost optimization and flow out of seeing these things appear and everything so I
I would just say like think about where could computer vision go if cost and
power consumption weren't a problem like imagine this let's say you're playing golf and you're um you know you build a
golf cap that has two cameras in front of it on the golf cap and it can actually track your golf shot and that's
only a $30 ad onto you know but you buy a golf cap and it's like the Supreme version and it cost a 100 bucks or Al so
Supreme would add a zero so it's a th000 say it's a th ,000 yeah no no that's too much that's too much though I'm talking
about like regular person golf cap so let's just say but that's for the that's for the supreme logo it's the cap is $20
the logo is you know 980 yes absolutely okay let's say it's a Nike cap though
but uh you know in the future we could we could potentially have literally a camera in that in your in the in the
front uh that that hard Edge on the front of a golf cap and that could be tracking golf shots I mean the number of
people would want to buy that millions millions that it's it's crazy what you could do when you free yourself from
okay this thing's got to have a huge battery and it's going to have this certain PCB size and we can't make it
flexible and it you know has a fixed camera with a huge lens on it and when you start getting into oh wait you know
we're going to build this stuff into clothing and you know we can build this into our light switch because it's got so cheap gotten so cheap and low power
that's that's kind of what I try to keep your eye on is is where can we push computer vision you know to the edge uh
and then Beyond the Edge like right now when people say Edge it's still mounted to a wall like how can we get it off Mount off the wall you know as the
that's a Michael Jackson song great Michael Jackson album actually yeah yeah big big one and then we have fion um
what's the estimated prices uh so we sell our system for a little bit over $100 um you know uh it used to be
cheaper but we had a lot of uh customers asking us for I/O interfaces and so we
realized that uh it's better to make it more expensive so you can connect it to anything than cut the price and have it
have limited functionality um the the base chip itself though is a lot less expensive so uh these mcus can be gotten
from you know less than $10 to actually build something with uh I try to run aany I'll take over the screen share for
a moment here and uh and share the open MV store here so people can get a little
little taste as it were all right folks yep there you go so uh currently
on the open MV products page you want to tell us anyit anything about these in
particular I see the the RT 1062 is the new new kit on the blocks yeah yeah yeah so RT 1062 we hired a professional
photographer to actually take good quality pictures that's why it looks so good it's beautiful um beautiful you know for that for that system one of the
things we really focused on was connectivity um so we added ethernet on board uh um you know Wi-Fi bluetoo bluo
um basically USB highspeed uh there's secure crypto chips on board uh it it
basically is everything you need to have a development platform that can be put and deployed into uh iot like
applications um this drove the cost up a little bit but it was all for uh just making it easier for folks to actually
be able to to actually deploy this device into a real environment um so
that was kind of our goal there because when we first started doing this was more like let's just slap an MCU on and a camera together and see what happens
and and that works but then a lot of folks are left with when they want to actually build a product and scale this out uh it becomes challenging because
you can't connect it to the right stuff and so we tried to alleviate that with this system by actually having real
connectivity built on board which I'll I'll demonstrate actually later in the show today it's killer that Wi-Fi is
built in on that that's a big deal yeah yeah no it it really helps um there's some examples of you know tracking uh
one of our biggest selling features is blob tracking because it's super easy you know it's a it's a very easy to train classifier um we've got a lot of
kids who use our product actually for something called the robocup um we've we've I'm familiar uh for folks that
aren't familiar give them a little the Iggy on the robocup oh yeah you know more or less they got a robot that needs
to basically knock a ball into a goal and so uh we've got that feature uh you
know covered they use a a tical mirror that kind of displays everything uh
circularly around the camera and then they just use color tracking to find the goal and that the robot's able to drive
around and see 360 around it um there's a few other things here I want to mention uh the Arduino Nicola vision is
kind of like a concept camera um that uh we see folks uh that that's been really
popular uh so this thing is the size of a posted stamp so literally size of a posted
stamp that's the whole system uh it's got Wi-Fi Bluetooth USB highspeed camera
microphone Square that's nuts yep and so this is what I mean by microcontrollers like you can make tiny systems put them
in anything you know we're not we're not uh if you had to add the emmc and if you had to add the SD ram then you know all
of a sudden that form factor doesn't work anymore just because those two chips alone aren't going to fit into that package and this is where I talk
about you know hey we're going to be able to put these things in all kinds of crazy systems uh because they're so tiny
um and yes we do have barcode detection and QR decoding on board the system so you can do that kind of stuff uh go back
yeah and then we had uh just some fun projects uh so by the way the H7 plus and the H7 R2 those are older systems uh
those are cheaper because those just focused on um no connection like basically it's just microcontroller and
camera and pretty simple but that that's what I meant about you know the lack of you know connectivity the the challenge
there is they're not able to get it online easily um and then uh one thing
we did that was pretty interesting was a concept camera called the pure thermal open MV uh and so that one you know
microcontrollers actually can drive HDMI I I didn't know it was possible but I gave it a shot and it turns out they
have a LCD bus interface and we were able to actually output uh HDMI uh to a
TV uh using a transmitter chip wow and uh the idea here was to see like what
could you do you might want to skip ahead in the video looks like there's some shout out to uh shout out to our
friends at hackster.io the official Community platform of open CV yeah so this one was actually showing off mix
thermal and color tracking at the same time so you combine a Fleer lepton with
uh just a 5 megapixel camera and then we added a display and we also added uh battery charging uh RAM on board Wi-Fi
uh we kind of went overboard here uh so it actually has too much stuff on it and it really wasn't cost optimized so this
is my first time like getting into just you know going at it and doing everything we wanted to do um yeah so I
learned from that though which is you know you do need to keep that price is a feature and not forget about that this
is the this is the open MV kitchen sink yes basically um but uh yeah it it was
fun to do [Music] um some nice lenses over here we got
infrared filter lens yeah yeah all kinds of stuff um you know one of the ideas
with open MV here is that we just wanted to most of the store products kind of help you enable your your idea like the
Fleer lepton adapter so you can do theral is one thing that people like a lot um and then uh there's Shields also you
can buy to like do Servo output and Etc and all that great stuff even TV um like
fpv drones we had people doing that back in the day oh wow it's great little yeah CV cvbs or whatever the yeah yellow yeah
you might think who does that but it actually turns out it's a great way to have a little display because you can get a $15 LCD screen that you know has a
ntsc in and then people actually will build machine equipment where they'll take an open m vcam and just mount it in
a production line and uh they'll actually just have a little screen that's attached to it that shows off
what it's doing as it's doesn't have to be doesn't have to be 1080p they're they're just trying to make it's just
for no glance at you know yeah they're just doing like 640 by 480 or 320 x 240
and goes on a screen and it's just meant to be like if it's if it's if the camera is like looking at uh um labels or
something like that and verifying it it's just to have to make sure machine is not you know going crazy and doing the wrong stuff right um anyway uh can I
take over again yeah please do okay actually here we'll we'll pause here before you share again and we'll do
our trivia giveaway we're we're about 12 minutes to the hour so um now is the time in the show where we give away
